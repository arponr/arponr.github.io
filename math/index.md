I'll be at Cambridge University for [Part III](//www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/mathiii/) during the 2015--16 academic year, and starting my PhD at Stanford University in Fall 2016. My mathematical interests are centered around homotopy theory. If you'd like more information, feel free to contact me at [arpon.raksit@gmail.com](mailto:arpon.raksit@gmail.com).
