## About

I'm currently a first-year PhD student in mathematics at Stanford. I was an undergraduate at Harvard from 2011--2015 and spent 2015--2016 at the University of Cambridge.

My mathematical interests are centered around homotopy theory. I am at the moment feeling particularly compelled towards the mysterious bridges being unearthed between stable homotopy theory and number theory.
