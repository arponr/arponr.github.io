  - title: Characters in global equivariant homotopy theory
    file: senior-thesis.pdf
    date: Mar 2015
    desc: My senior thesis, on the generalized character theory of
          Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel and Stapleton, utilizing the language
          of global equivariant homotopy theory. (In an ideal world
          this would have a been a polished, formal document, but it's
          really quite rough for now; unsurprisingly, the actual
          writing process ended up being rather concentrated around
          the due date.)
  - title: Vector fields on spheres
    file: vfields.pdf
    date: May 2014
    desc: On the ideas in Adams's solution to the problem of finding
          vector fields on spheres, and its relation to his work on
          the J-homomorphism.
  - title: Defining the cotangent complex
    file: quillen-cotangent.pdf
    date: Dec 2013
    desc: On Quillen's application of the theory of model categories
          to defining a homology theory of algebras in analogy with
          singular homology.
  - title: The Dold-Kan correspondence
    file: doldkan.pdf
    date: Oct 2013
    desc: A proof of the titular result, and a couple of quick
          consequences.
