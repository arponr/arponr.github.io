  - title: Characters in global equivariant homotopy theory
    file: senior-thesis.pdf
    date: March 2015
    desc: My senior thesis, giving an exposition of the
          Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel character theory (and Stapleton's
          generalization), taking advantage of the language of global
          equivariant homotopy theory. In an ideal world this would
          have a been a polished, formal document, but it's really
          quite rough (unsurprisingly, the actual writing process
          ended up being rather concentrated around the due date). A
          cleaner version should (hopefully) appear in the (somewhat)
          near future.
  - title: Vector fields on spheres
    file: vfields.pdf
    date: May 2014
    desc: An exposition of the ideas in Adams's solution to the problem
          of finding vector fields on spheres, and its relation to his
          work on the J-homomorphism.
  - title: Defining the cotangent complex
    file: quillen-cotangent.pdf
    date: Dec 2013
    desc: An exposition of Quillen's application of the theory of
          model categories to defining a homology theory of algebras
          in analogy with singular homology.
  - title: The Dold-Kan correspondence
    file: doldkan.pdf
    date: Oct 2013
    desc: A proof of the titular result, and a couple of quick
          consequences.
