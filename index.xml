      <title>Spectral algebraic theories I: derived categories</title>

      <description>We formulate a general construction that uniformly produces the derived ∞-category of complexes of abelian groups, the ∞-category of derived commutative rings, and the ∞-category of MU-synthetic spectra. The construction is characterized by a universal property, similar to the theory of animation. The three named examples belong to a class of ∞-categories that we call spectral algebraic ∞-categories, and our results rely on general observations about such ∞-categories and how to construct them.</description>

      <description>my memories don&amp;rsquo;t dry up,&#xA;i am the bathing bird.&#xA;how did you, like that plane, vanish&#xA;into the cloud?&#xA;in my eyes, the remnant sky&#xA;becomes a few blue flowers.&#xA;under my hovering hands, i feel fabric,&#xA;checkered, undulating.&#xA;i turn off my light,&#xA;i vanish into the natural night.</description>

      <description>in August&amp;rsquo;s dusk,&#xA;summer&amp;rsquo;s constriction&#xA;lapses.&#xA;someone loosened the cinch.&#xA;maybe it was the stretch of evening.&#xA;maybe it was the cicadas&amp;rsquo; will.&#xA;here is a new way, a loophole in death&amp;rsquo;s gravity.&#xA;here is a pastel green forest of streetlamps.&#xA;here is a bronze installation of white ash.&#xA;here in the seasons&amp;rsquo; margins,&#xA;someone left a circular note.&#xA;maybe it was the birch&amp;rsquo;s decision to peel.&#xA;recall the circumstances: they encompass</description>

      <description>Over the dark summer soil,&#xA;what color are the leaves&#xA;fluttering in emptiness,&#xA;an uplifting breeze,&#xA;which turns&#xA;them into new&#xA;altitudes,&#xA;like an airplane&amp;rsquo;s ascent,&#xA;which contains its descent.&#xA;Always confronting the world that is&#xA;and the world that isn&amp;rsquo;t,&#xA;it takes time and space&#xA;and the analogy between them,&#xA;but one starts to know one&#xA;behind many, the pilot eternally&#xA;locked away in the breeze&amp;rsquo;s scent.&#xA;From the shrouded clarity of a peak</description>

      <description>1. I wander like a hawk&#xA;above the possibility of prey,&#xA;I wander like the wind.&#xA;2. Just like the land beneath these feet,&#xA;these feet that walk over this land&#xA;and the sensations of these feet walking over this land&#xA;are not owned by me but by the timber company.&#xA;Their signage is everywhere, and their machinery,&#xA;and their creation and destruction,&#xA;these traces of their true nature,&#xA;which remains invisible.</description>

      <description>Waking up to the first quiet morning in months, I stretch, I wash, I stroll, I waft towards the smell of cardamom, I read that everything died some time ago, I think of we who remain here in the dream of that death, our understandable confusion, the way we gather by the stream, with the trees, for water, then hypnotized by the endless flow of meaning. I join the others. We do our small part of honest work, and then we escape, in search of a stream, the protection of the canopy, the correct path, correct alignment with the satellites, the type of algae that may grant us just one more life, clues about what the others have seen.</description>

      <description>i close my eyes and see an orange box containing purple.&#xA;i think about my thoughts yesterday about my weak mental imagery.&#xA;these thoughts, and thoughts about recording the experience,&#xA;interfere with my vision of the box. it weakens.&#xA;i try to let go of the interference and return to the box.&#xA;it shifts, maybe a fruit. i think of jam, and preservation.</description>

      <description>September Do we begin with the past, present, or future?&#xA;Do we lovingly resist these urges?&#xA;I scurry arround building infrastructure to breathe.&#xA;I float on light steps enveloped by your voice&amp;rsquo;s ease.&#xA;And in silence, I find comfort in my own song.&#xA;Do we keep the most important things to ourselves?&#xA;I did only what I could: I waited for your word, I rested, and I rode.&#xA;May these new floods return us to lost comforts.</description>

      <description>How are you?&#xA;Can you help me?&#xA;Nothing is good,&#xA;Nothing is bad.&#xA;Continuity is everything,&#xA;It is easy to destroy.&#xA;Living through these experiences,&#xA;I am reminded of that.&#xA;A cloud moves on,&#xA;The birds move on and return.&#xA;The spring surfaces,&#xA;I walk along.&#xA;I want to see deeper,&#xA;without destruction.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to wake up,&#xA;or go to sleep.&#xA;The flowers return,&#xA;and move on.</description>

      <description>We were all taking a big inhale when all of a sudden an unexpected train zoomed past us, and in its wake, as we exhaled, we saw that all of the snow had melted, and the land was revealed to be a desert. The change was abrupt and uncomfortable; we had difficulty adapting; and soon, we were dessicated: the substance of us&amp;mdash;our children too, their substance being especially, visibly fluid&amp;mdash;it all evaporated; we became all sorts of clouds in the sky.</description>

      <description>A wolf would only come so close to you if it hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed your presence. You may wonder how that could come to be; you likely have a belief in you, deep and from long ago, that wolves are equipped with keen senses. There is evidence that supports that belief, but there are other matters to be considered too. How was the wind? It has been so windy here recently. People keep bringing it up in my vicinity as they greet one another, and then they look outside together at the gusting leaves, and then they look back at each other with concern and understanding.</description>

      <description>He kept going to the river. When there, he would sit on a pier or crouch by the bank, and he would start moving into a meditation, when suddenly, in the corner of an eye, in the half of the corner that was still open, he would sense the shadow of a fish jumping out of and then back into the water. He would then open his eyes fully, and he would search the water for some time, but no other fish would appear.</description>

      <description>1. To the cafe owner, she said, you do one thing, and then two other things come up because of that, and then another one actually, and things just keep piling up, just like time, I may have said a few years ago, and then she turned to me and she checked, isn&amp;rsquo;t that right?&#xA;2. He looked somewhere near me and he said, don&amp;rsquo;t sink here like a giant stone obstructing the flow of things, and I turned into ice, and I floated downstream.</description>

      <description>I pretend I am nothing, but then a bird on a wire in the sun, a cloud in the breeze on a hill, and then I seem to be something, like these.&#xA;In Gurye, as I translate the river road signs from speedbump to otter, the Princeton spring surfaces, like when in a Cambridge fall I found ochre from Gurye.&#xA;I sink into here, I drink the things I see or don&amp;rsquo;t, barley, rice, sugar, peach, pedals translating me, between modest elevations, temperatures, degrees of carbonation.</description>

      <description>When, in my notes, I write an aside to myself, to remind&#xA;or lament, and to, eventually, be deleted, I do it in the shade&#xA;of purple that I feel closest to that season.&#xA;A dark, little bird crosses over the canal, and tips her head&#xA;down towards the water, and catches, briefly, the blur&#xA;of the brighter, purple accents of her belly&amp;rsquo;s plummage.&#xA;Is it ok for me to write on a day like this, when</description>

      <description>1. I want to tell you everything, but I cannot. For one, I do not know much.&#xA;I learn a little by listening&#xA;to songs I found one month ago.&#xA;Or by closing my eyes and gazing&#xA;at the patterns formed by the competition&#xA;of two sources of light. And I remain&#xA;on the lookout for these processes,&#xA;for a methodology to approach you,&#xA;to change, gently, intelligently.&#xA;For now, I remain a child,</description>

      <description>Good morning, Institute community,&#xA;Thank you for your continued accommodation during this period of spring renovation on our campus. As the tree excision and path retiling have been completed without incident and according to schedule, the work will advance as planned.&#xA;In the coming days, there will be significant person removal activity around Feld Hall. We will carry on doing our best to limit disruption to our campus. Several persons around Feld Hall, D Building, A Building, and B Building have lived quite long with managed care and regular maintenance.</description>

      <description>I remember the revelatory feeling of remembering events that had, and have now again, slipped completely from memory. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to distinguish either level of this recollection from dream, so I don&amp;rsquo;t, I follow something else, back to a museum of photography, where I linger in a room to enjoy the resonance of the work, the dimmed lights, the electronic music, and the low voices of a young, French couple.</description>

      <description>she was a teacher of mine, i enjoyed saying aloud,&#xA;which could be why i am walking through the halls&#xA;of the gallery, yet why will i later remember&#xA;the gallery&amp;rsquo;s rooms while revering the changing light?&#xA;at these times, i am thinking of the possibilities&#xA;of transcending and of forsaking everything, which we are&#xA;too small to collect, and carrying on collecting&#xA;things which emerge mysteriously from the past,</description>

      <description>i awake among blue mornings,&#xA;the round calls of a suburban bird,&#xA;so many dogs, leashed and unleashed,&#xA;and memories, unleashed, one by one.&#xA;they become the cool air of the dream&#xA;where i meet old friends and fantasies,&#xA;which become the yellow afternoon.&#xA;with unbelievable care, they dig out&#xA;a knot i swallowed, back on my tongue&#xA;with a fresh fermented flavor, which,&#xA;i&amp;rsquo;m told, may affect the scent of my sweat.</description>

A female security guard.&#xA;A girl, who is with her mother, notices a lizard</description>

      <description>He laughed at my misfortune.&#xA;At his own convenience, he left me alone.&#xA;He took much pleasure in the company and fantasy of other women, to the degradation of our own.&#xA;He suffered from a kind of laziness that prevented him from taking responsibility or the lead.&#xA;He did something good, too, something specific and even poetic, indeed it was this good thing, or perhaps it was more of an abstract trait, that came to my mind first, and led to the writing of this poem, but which departed before the writing commenced, and then did not return in a definite form by the time the writing ended.</description>

      <description>Defines the &amp;ldquo;even filtration&amp;rdquo; on an arbitrary commutative ring spectrum; uses this to recharacterize Bhatt&amp;ndash;Morrow&amp;ndash;Scholze&amp;rsquo;s motivic filtrations on THH, TC&amp;ndash;, TP, TC of quasisyntomic commutative rings (and hence their syntomic cohomology, i.e. the associated graded of the filtration on TC), and then extend these to &amp;ldquo;chromatically quasisyntomic&amp;rdquo; commutative ring spectra, such as S, MU, ku (and its Adams summand at any prime), ko, and tmf; finally, calculates the mod (p,v1) syntomic cohomology of the Adams summand at p, realizing part of a picture conjectured by Rognes.</description>

      <description>The temperature is well below freezing, and the property manager has notified their tenants that the heating systems in their buildings cannot help but operate less efficiently in the present conditions. That must be the reason for my hearing, from inside the radiator: the violent bubbling of an unwatched stew; the desparate knocking of thousands of tiny gnomes; a tennis match greatly complicated by the nonstandard, coiled geometry of the court; the lurching of a vessel, like a boat or a stomach, at sea; a child slipping down the stairs; an alien turning to sludge in an unfavorable environment; a jazz drummer alone.</description>

      <description>These were supposed to be the lines that came to me earlier in the day, when I was feeling deeply about the ordinary. But those lines have since escaped me. They were plain lines, like these, but they were also sublime, as I saw that moment, as opposed to these more muted lines. That is what I seem to be able to recall.</description>

      <description>In Palo Alto, in spring, some weeks&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s summer, some winter, some spring.&#xA;I learned these words somewhere else.&#xA;Mostly it&amp;rsquo;s spring and summer. Here they give&#xA;their hands to each other: one will pull&#xA;and then the other, twirling around the room.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s hard not to get caught in their rhythmic fold:&#xA;everyone&amp;rsquo;s surfing out here. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget&#xA;something small, deep below the surface.&#xA;A dreadful interjection of winter isn&amp;rsquo;t what rouses</description>

      <description>Would you stop speaking to me in English?&#xA;I would prefer that you use another language,&#xA;one that I do not understand&amp;mdash;perhaps yours?&#xA;&amp;mdash;and synchronously display English subtitles.&#xA;The separation helps me, embarrassingly.&#xA;It keeps my mind from squashing&#xA;the wonderful moving shapes&#xA;that you speak.&#xA;It lets them in,&#xA;shiver with meaning.&#xA;It is also a little&#xA;excuse for me&#xA;to avert my eyes.&#xA;I am sorry.&#xA;I am working on the problem</description>

      <description>How did I get here? I ask myself, struggling to contend with the boulder atop me and the Earth below, each exerting their natural forces. I have only a ragged memory of what came before this&amp;mdash;a pleasant stroll on the mountain, a little hunger&amp;hellip; And then? I am at a loss. It all feels inappropriate.&#xA;The sun is rising or setting and the wind is weaving through the tree line or being wrung from my body.</description>

      <description>When you awake, my room is ochre,&#xA;adrift, I mistake your breath for autumn.&#xA;The seasons change like that,&#xA;we make efforts to capture the moments.&#xA;The way one is with another,&#xA;bitter and sweet, like a hammer meets a string.&#xA;And then departs, like the lift of the key.&#xA;I too will leave the scene, make way, wake me&#xA;as you leave me.</description>

      <description>Our ancestors would utter things like, What do you wot of that traveller?&#xA;The verb there is to wit, synonymous with to know, but with an especially mischievous set of conjugations: present tense wot, present participle witting, past tense and past participle wist.&#xA;(The word does survive in our times in the adverbial phrase to wit, though, to my understanding, this is employed exclusively in legal contexts or in affecting a hoity-toity attitude.</description>

A pianist posed the question to me recently, and it has returned to me more than once. Or rather, what leads these returns is an inaccuracy I&amp;rsquo;ve recognized in the response I gave; still, the question itself follows along too.</description>

      <description>The space in the home had initially been empty, but a clutter accumulated over the years. Perhaps it was the bookshelves that were first installed: text required notation, hence required purchase. It did not take long for the collection to spill beyond the shelves. The desk was introduced when it was realized that some kind of office was needed in the home, to cordon off the working mind, and an additional lamp, chair, and couch then became necessary to enable shifts in disposition during rumination.</description>

      <description>proper nouns sung&#xA;with the ache of history, or&#xA;the undulating body&#xA;of a kitten pawing forward.&#xA;such things make me feel&#xA;my bones, and a humble&#xA;beauty in physicality.&#xA;as if lying in the dew&#xA;and half-light of early morning&#xA;before undertaking the work&#xA;of the mind, the gallant&#xA;defense of the intellect.&#xA;or after all that, when too&#xA;it is lovely to remember&#xA;that you and i are creatures,</description>

      <description>no, the hot light of day&#xA;obscures, exhausts, and&#xA;makes a liar out of me.&#xA;it’s the damp cover of&#xA;the cave&amp;mdash;settling&#xA;the earth, the nerves&amp;mdash;&#xA;that reveals&#xA;the trickle of the heart&#xA;and these threadbare chords&#xA;with which i am bound&#xA;and reconciled.&#xA;run your palms along&#xA;the ridged walls and curl&#xA;your fingers through the moss.&#xA;i am called to know this&#xA;and to feel this all, intimately.</description>

      <description>Out on the porch&amp;ndash;the pier,&#xA;the night is tinted indigo&amp;ndash;violet&#xA;and the moon is looking radiant.&#xA;You can hear but not see&#xA;the fireworks. Instead,&#xA;with each explosion, the light&#xA;of one or two or three fireflies&#xA;among the trees&amp;ndash;the reeds,&#xA;like sparks freed from smoldering logs,&#xA;or the glint of the flames in your love’s eyes,&#xA;or in your heart, as you remember&#xA;how you watched her watch fire.</description>

      <description>When exactly did ivy begin crawling&#xA;up my distinguished stone skin? When, exactly,&#xA;did I decide my skin was best cloaked&#xA;in stone-grey? I swear that my skin once shined&#xA;like fresh copper—in 2002, maybe, a pool party&#xA;at my Greek friend George’s house thrown&#xA;because he was moving away, to Georgia, funnily&#xA;and sadly, though I didn’t know so then.&#xA;On Princeton’s campus is a copper statue&#xA;wearing the verdigris of historicity.</description>

      <description>She slips into and disappears behind&#xA;flesh, cloth, and metal,&#xA;rushing forever into the past.&#xA;The rats licking the tracks clean&#xA;while visions of the future rise,&#xA;desolate, eschatological,&#xA;infinitely bifurcating in space and time,&#xA;resonating cold up the spine, and&#xA;coalescing in premonitions of tears.&#xA;Your tired heart holds desperately on and&#xA;up by the collar, limbs flailing in the skyline,&#xA;for even amidst this gravity&#xA;there are weightless observers,</description>

      <description>The young man was at a party in a ballroom. He might still be. That&amp;rsquo;s the beginning and end of this story.&#xA;He wore a requisitely nice white shirt and black pants. A dark grey tie hung firmly around his neck and gleaming black shoes kept him just off the floor. He pulled off his suit jacket when he noticed he was warm, rolled and rumpled up his sleeves when later he began to sweat.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re on the Metro North Railroad, travelling from Grand Central Station to Stamford, CT, seated facing the rear of the train, neck twisted towards the window on your left. You slip in your earbuds and welcome that Irish genius&amp;rsquo;s crooning into your blood. Your eyes open and close as the old train wobbles leisurely out of the dim tunnel.&#xA;The darkness continues into the city air, the night creeping into day as summer tapers away.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s two o&amp;rsquo;clock in the suburban afternoon. A grey sky hangs low outside, whispering in the back of everyone&amp;rsquo;s mind re looming rainfall. Miscellaneous questions are caught in the whispers and whirl forward into consciousness—Are the cushions on the patio chairs out? Does the garden need to be humanly watered?—landing one after another in a paralyzing mess—Should that errand be run now or postponed until the rain has passed?—like piles of crisp dead leaves you&amp;rsquo;ve tucked against the curb being scattered back over your lawn by gusts of wind.</description>

      <title>Transcendence in Infinite Jest</title>

      <description>Introduction One needs only reach the twelfth page of Infinite Jest1 to be confronted with philosophy: Hal&amp;rsquo;s very first utterances express his beliefs that &amp;ldquo;the influence of Kierkegaard on Camus is underestimated&amp;rdquo;, that &amp;ldquo;Hobbes is just Rousseau in a dark mirror&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;with Hegel, that transcendence is absorption&amp;rdquo;. It is my belief that these statements are not simply supercilious name-dropping (either on Hal&amp;rsquo;s or David Foster Wallace&amp;rsquo;s part), but serious hints that central aspects of the novel should be understood in a philosophical context.</description>
