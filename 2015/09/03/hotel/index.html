        <p>Waft up into the atmosphere with all the other in-flight scents, for
some precisely prescribed but immaterial length of time, drifting and
swirling and who knows what goes on at those altitudes, till the
prescription runs out and you are sucked down into the world. Fall
through infinity—fractals of branching passages, vague semiotics,
and cordoned sinusoids—till infinity spits you out in front of
Arrivals. Watch sinister, swarthy creatures slouching by towards
Departures while you wait to diffuse into some vehicle which barely
stops and then flows, onward, submerged in a viscous
cavalcade. Surface and emerge, finally, at your destination. The night
is dark red and pulsing.</p>

<p>Come inside, welcome. This hotel is nestled at the heart of me.</p>

<h2 id="floor-eleven">Floor Eleven</h2>

<p>It’s October of 2004, and the hallway is lined with those lurid
lockers, the ones which send the average American hurtling back in
fits of nostalgia toward some teenage point in spacetime. Only this is
one of my not-even-teen years, and it’s right here and now.</p>

<p>Look at me—no, not at me, at not-even-teen me—leaning like I must
have seen on tv against an orange locker adjacent to her orange
locker. I’m fidgeting, imperceptibly I hope, maybe even just
inwardly. A pen full of red ink comes out of my pocket and into my
hand and begins to fidget with me. What am I saying?</p>

<p>“. . . .”</p>

<p>I capital-L Like, a.k.a. like-like, her. Who knows why. Are we even
friends? Seriously, what am I saying? That capital-L has planted
itself right inside me, its roots reach far deeper than my sorry logic
could ever dig.</p>

<p>“. . . .”</p>

<p>My neck squirms, eyes wander, searching for some wit or charm or
something, but something else finds me: the pen explodes. The
idiomatic explosion is more metaphoric than literal though, the spray
of ink scrawny and pathetic, yet in perfectly catastrophic trajectory,
existing in all the wrong places and moments.</p>

<p>I am too young for innuendo to apply. This is real.</p>

<p>Dear god, I am bleeding all over her and her baby-blue North Face
fleece. So many dreams shatter around me as my glossy oxygenated red
struggles to harmonize with her soft baby-blue, like some grotesque
hall of inconsistently colored mirrors. My neck snaps into place, eyes
freeze, and, as neck- and eye-mobility appear to be gradually
transferred over to her, she slowly lifts her heavy gaze from her
orange locker. The gaze, expressing and therefore evoking terror,
thuds down onto me. I need to react. I Like her so much I’m
bleeding. I need a reaction.</p>

<p>I laugh. I double over, laughing.</p>

<p>Her terror metamorphoses in between eye-blinks: into anger, then
sadness, then disgust; all those feelings I decide between mirroring
eye-blinks I had always wanted from her. Yes, of course, I hate her
with all my heart.</p>

<p>“. . . .”</p>

<p>Does she say something? A ventricle is pounding at my ear, and I am
far too busy with my laughter. A bell interposes to notify us the day
is over, cackling along with me as my brand new nemesis storms off
into the afternoon.</p>

<hr />

<p>me: hey s—-
