    <p>in August&rsquo;s dusk,<br>
summer&rsquo;s constriction<br>
lapses.</p>
<p>someone loosened the cinch.<br>
maybe it was the stretch of evening.<br>
maybe it was the cicadas&rsquo; will.</p>
<p>here is a new way, a loophole in death&rsquo;s gravity.<br>
here is a pastel green forest of streetlamps.<br>
here is a bronze installation of white ash.</p>
<p>here in the seasons&rsquo; margins,<br>
someone left a circular note.<br>
maybe it was the birch&rsquo;s decision to peel.</p>
<p>recall the circumstances: they encompass<br>
everything and nothing; i affix these<br>
two wheels to my frame, and i slip away.</p>

    <p>Over the dark summer soil,<br>
what color are the leaves<br>
fluttering in emptiness,<br>
an uplifting breeze,<br>
which turns<br>
them into new<br>
altitudes,<br>
like an airplane&rsquo;s ascent,<br>
which contains its descent.</p>
<p>Always confronting the world that is<br>
and the world that isn&rsquo;t,<br>
it takes time and space<br>
and the analogy between them,<br>
but one starts to know one<br>
behind many, the pilot eternally<br>
locked away in the breeze&rsquo;s scent.</p>
<p>From the shrouded clarity of a peak<br>
comes an offering of kindness:<br>
there is no end.<br>
There is the warmth of friendship<br>
in the earthworms&rsquo; steam,<br>
there is the music of things<br>
turning into things.</p>

    <h2 id="1">1.</h2>
<p>I wander like a hawk<br>
above the possibility of prey,<br>
I wander like the wind.</p>
<h2 id="2">2.</h2>
<p>Just like the land beneath these feet,<br>
these feet that walk over this land<br>
and the sensations of these feet walking over this land<br>
are not owned by me but by the timber company.<br>
Their signage is everywhere, and their machinery,<br>
and their creation and destruction,<br>
these traces of their true nature,<br>
which remains invisible.</p>
<p>To summarize: here on this forest road,<br>
betweeen thickets of trees, I am trespassing.<br>
The yellow and black striped warning tape was cut,<br>
it waves quietly in the wind.</p>
<h2 id="3">3.</h2>
<p>Other than humans, who have drawn up<br>
many nutrients from the soil, and proliferated,<br>
large animals are few and barely reveal themselves.<br>
One gallops by while my sight is closed<br>
and my attention is mostly in my limbs.<br>
Another takes off, or dives, in the cover of the brush,<br>
from one unknown realm to another,<br>
as I continue along the exposed trail.</p>
<h2 id="4">4.</h2>
<p>There are ways that the light falls in the thicket<br>
only.</p>
<h2 id="5">5.</h2>
<p>Falling asleep, I am haunted by the day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>A stone kneeling beside me in the garden<br>
flashes me a message as<br>
I kill the thistle and teasel,<br>
with whom I live and die.</p>
<p>I listen to the muffled memories<br>
of the ghost of the creek<br>
as I choke it with coarse debris.</p>
<p>Over and over I drive an axe into the bark<br>
of a fallen tree, to gain purchase and to peel,<br>
to discover the messages that were sent<br>
between the skin and the flesh.</p>
<h2 id="6">6.</h2>
<p>The meeting hall chants along;<br>
it has its own creaks to work out.<br>
The bamboo moves through its own<br>
subtle asanas, and keeps becoming.</p>
<h2 id="7">7.</h2>
<p>The world isn&rsquo;t flat, I heard it fold under a bird&rsquo;s wing.<br>
So that knowledge appeared in the pocket of an ear<br>
and then climbed into a poem.</p>
<h2 id="8">8.</h2>
<p>If you pass through the pines,<br>
and make a second effort,<br>
you&rsquo;ll find that the creek still lives.<br>
There is the sky, right on the earth,<br>
rippling as the birds ring<br>
and insects laugh and light dances.<br>
The light, and hence the dark, attends<br>
to everything, and I follow. When I depart,<br>
I am caught by the vines, who have missed me.</p>

    <p>Waking up to the first quiet morning in months, I stretch, I wash, I stroll, I waft towards the smell of cardamom, I read that everything died some time ago, I think of we who remain here in the dream of that death, our understandable confusion, the way we gather by the stream, with the trees, for water, then hypnotized by the endless flow of meaning. I join the others. We do our small part of honest work, and then we escape, in search of a stream, the protection of the canopy, the correct path, correct alignment with the satellites, the type of algae that may grant us just one more life, clues about what the others have seen. We return inside to play a different game, we investigate our hands and feet, we root for one another. We gather around the table and consider, in laughter and solemnity, our lives, the food we have eaten, the time we have wasted. Following a moment of recognition, of savoring, of resistance, I leave the others. I begin to ascend the hill when I hear and then drift towards the sound of live rhythm, and I find myself among the redwoods swaying in warmth, luck, constant flux: we have to keep leaving and remembering, that&rsquo;s part of the work, or is it? I leave the rhythm, I remember that I have accidentally stolen a key, the rhythm leaves me, I worry, I plan, I stroll, I tell myself everything is going to be ok, I stretch, I wash, I sleep.</p>

<p>Do we begin with the past, present, or future?<br>
Do we lovingly resist these urges?<br>
I scurry arround building infrastructure to breathe.<br>
I float on light steps enveloped by your voice&rsquo;s ease.<br>
And in silence, I find comfort in my own song.<br>
Do we keep the most important things to ourselves?<br>
I did only what I could: I waited for your word, I rested, and I rode.<br>
May these new floods return us to lost comforts.<br>

    <p>We were all taking a big inhale when all of a sudden an unexpected train zoomed past us, and in its wake, as we exhaled, we saw that all of the snow had melted, and the land was revealed to be a desert. The change was abrupt and uncomfortable; we had difficulty adapting; and soon, we were dessicated: the substance of us&mdash;our children too, their substance being especially, visibly fluid&mdash;it all evaporated; we became all sorts of clouds in the sky. Each of us had to deal with this in our own way, of course, but after drifting in uncertainty, in strange, changing formations, for many years, it seems that we began reaching similar conclusions, and it began to rain. Finally, we were gentle, and we could give ourselves back. If the snow returns, I will not know.</p>

the impatient, desperate desecration of trees<br>
the gentle waves at the edge of the lake<br>
the patient mountain at the edge of town<br>
the doubt in me: must i write, here, at the edge of completeness?<br>
do i desecrate each moment out of habit?<br>
out of a deep drive for business?<br>
i tell myself to write briefly, to love, too,<br>
the gentle waves of thought, and to leave something behind<br>
to turn to when i have turned myself around<br>

<p>To the cafe owner, she said, you do one thing, and then two other things come up because of that, and then another one actually, and things just keep piling up, just like time, I may have said a few years ago, and then she turned to me and she checked, isn&rsquo;t that right?</p>

<p>Recalling their readings at the table, they said to me in a rare harmony, there are four stages of grief, the first two are light, it is the third one that is deep, and important, it is then that all our cells get cleaned out and refreshed, and it is in the fourth stage where we dream.</p>

    <p>I was waving to you from where I always was,<br>
the future, which does not exist, and I keep<br>
looping in and out, trying to get a good take.</p>
<p>The moon is beautiful, on the impossible blue grain<br>
of this evening, so I break out laughing, and I keep<br>
a souvenir for the next loop, which could go any way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hope, that the forbidden relaxes into itself,<br>
and I keep becoming myself, time and time again,<br>
and you&rsquo;ll be anywhere, you&rsquo;ll be everywhere.</p>

    <p>I remember the revelatory feeling of remembering events that had, and have now again, slipped completely from memory. It&rsquo;s difficult to distinguish either level of this recollection from dream, so I don&rsquo;t, I follow something else, back to a museum of photography, where I linger in a room to enjoy the resonance of the work, the dimmed lights, the electronic music, and the low voices of a young, French couple.</p>
<p>Here, to illustrate, I would sample the voice of your aging mother, set to a contemporary beat, despite extreme difficulty in deciding on the meaning of contemporary (no earlier than 1850? that we are still alive?), and in spite of or inspired by my inability to understand a word of hers, I hope that her past, her dreams, her knowledge, her illusions would resonate with the times and comfort us.</p>
<p>This is for us; sadly, I cannot do anything for her; I do not &amp; will not know either of you. It&rsquo;s ok, a voice reports to me. It&rsquo;s important to maintain a proper distance, and this is just the first instance of.</p>

which could be why i am walking through the halls<br>
of the gallery, yet why will i later remember<br>
the gallery&rsquo;s rooms while revering the changing light?<br>
at these times, i am thinking of the possibilities<br>
of transcending and of forsaking everything, which we are<br>
too small to collect, and carrying on collecting<br>
things which emerge mysteriously from the past,<br>
things swirling out from nothing, like a mist,<br>
things masters and laborers stored carefully<br>
and improvisationally in layers of paint.</p>
<p>here, finally, the subject of love arises,<br>
and i feel a desire for a shift in style,<br>
concrete, stark, and elegant,<br>
but this will require patience, a great deal<br>
more of courage and freedom, and now<br>
i am dead tired, and almost home, and the heat<br>
is out over the sea and the city, like a myth.</p>

a knot i swallowed, back on my tongue<br>
with a fresh fermented flavor, which,<br>

what does any of this have to do with<br>
the food that i eat, the materials<br>

love is always failing and neverending.<br>
don&rsquo;t be afraid, it was great to see<br>
your smiling face, congratulations, can i<br>
hold you a little longer, some of me may stay<br>
hidden, nestled in the branches of a redwood,<br>
with its fine leaves and small cones,<br>

I followed the signs to the cactus garden<br>

my shoes and bags configured below.<br>
There is not too much light here, just small lamps<br>
placed at the base of the plants along the path.<br>
Every so often, someone new enters the garden.<br>
A male security guard. A female security guard.<br>
A girl, who is with her mother, notices a lizard<br>
on an abandoned cup near me, which I had not.<br>
They circle the garden, then the mother asks me to take<br>
their photo, gesturing repeatedly to raise the brightness<br>
of the image on her phone as she hands it to me.<br>
I try to frame them and the cacti appropriately.<br>
Thank you. The cacti move in the wind. The lizard becomes two.<br>
I’m waiting for something strange to happen<br>
and I’m breathing, trying to become a part of the interim.<br>
As I get up to leave, I turn and see the two guards,<br>
their uniformed intimacy, the orange of their cigarettes.</p>

<p>He did something good, too, something specific and even poetic, indeed it was this good thing, or perhaps it was more of an abstract trait, that came to my mind first, and led to the writing of this poem, but which departed before the writing commenced, and then did not return in a definite form by the time the writing ended.</p>

    <p>her voice closed our eyes,<br>
and when they opened,<br>
there it all was, again<br>
and brand new:<br>
the rows of eucalyptus<br>
like weathered bone<br>
towering behind the stage;<br>
the meadow we huddled in<br>
before it&mdash;before her,<br>
the sylph singing in the grove,<br>
lightly pulling down<br>
the skin on her face;<br>
the sunlight turned grey<br>
working its way through<br>
the San Francisco sky,<br>
then deep green through the glade;<br>
the pair of older, moustached<br>
Japanese men to my right,<br>
reclined and pouring cups<br>
of red wine for one another<br>
to enjoy with slices of salami;<br>
the toddler&rsquo;s babble at my back&hellip;<br>
it was all there at once,<br>
the world that is,<br>
a bright shock and then an embrace,<br>
a clean plunge into cool water;<br>
my eyes were open and i held my breath.</p>

    <p>see the tide working<br>
at the shelves of granite<br>
off the shores of maine,<br>
each wake caressing<br>
the dark rock in eddies.</p>
<p>see the patterns of erosion<br>
in the cliffside &amp; at our feet,<br>
the material segmenting like<br>
data, like a thought transforming<br>
into a sent message.</p>
<hr>
<p>i wondered if that was you<br>
biking along the shoulder,<br>
the yellowgreen windbreaker<br>
&amp; blue shorts glowing<br>
in the daylight, and briefly<br>
my insides tensed:</p>
<p>you see, i fall in love with<br>
ease, gentle acts<br>
of consideration or camaraderie<br>
&mdash;a message received transforming;<br>
with these, you envelop<br>
me, and i erode.</p>

knead me, till i am smooth and pliable,<br>

<p>would you lay each of me upon the press?<br>
between crackling parchment, between the<br>
time-worn plates, and you’d give your weight<br>
to the lever, and i’d give away my height.</p>
<p>would you heat cast iron beneath me?<br>
so i could live a little, puff my chest<br>

<p>like fresh copper—in 2002, maybe, a pool party<br>

because he was moving away, to Georgia, funnily<br>
and sadly, though I didn’t know so then.</p>
<p>On Princeton’s campus is a copper statue<br>
wearing the verdigris of historicity.<br>
But look at the the plinth: the figure<br>
was established in 1993, the patina painted,</p>
<p>artifice to be washed away in drops of sincerity.<br>
A statue of reversed temporality, to one day shine alive.</p>

flesh, cloth, and metal,<br>
rushing forever into the past.<br>
The rats licking the tracks clean<br>
while visions of the future rise,<br>
desolate, eschatological,<br>
infinitely bifurcating in space and time,<br>
resonating cold up the spine, and<br>
coalescing in premonitions of tears.<br>
Your tired heart holds desperately on and<br>
up by the collar, limbs flailing in the skyline,<br>
for even amidst this gravity<br>
there are weightless observers,<br>
there are trains and friends to miss and catch,<br>
there are stairs to climb, seas to sail,<br>
the north star extinguished.</p>
