  <h1>Water Lilies</h1>
  
  <div class="post--content">
    <p>she was a teacher of mine, i enjoyed saying aloud,<br>
which could be why i am walking through the halls<br>
of the gallery, yet why will i later remember<br>
the gallery&rsquo;s rooms while revering the changing light?<br>
at these times, i am thinking of the possibilities<br>
of transcending and of forsaking everything, which we are<br>
too small to collect, and carrying on collecting<br>
things which emerge mysteriously from the past,<br>
things swirling out from nothing, like a mist,<br>
things masters and laborers stored carefully<br>
and improvisationally in layers of paint.</p>
<p>here, finally, the subject of love arises,<br>
and i feel a desire for a shift in style,<br>
concrete, stark, and elegant,<br>
but this will require patience, a great deal<br>
more of courage and freedom, and now<br>
i am dead tired, and almost home, and the heat<br>
is out over the sea and the city, like a myth.</p>
