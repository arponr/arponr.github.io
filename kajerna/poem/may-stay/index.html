  <h1>Some of me may stay</h1>
  
  <div class="post--content">
    <p>i awake among blue mornings,<br>
the round calls of a suburban bird,<br>
so many dogs, leashed and unleashed,<br>
and memories, unleashed, one by one.<br>
they become the cool air of the dream<br>
where i meet old friends and fantasies,<br>
which become the yellow afternoon.<br>
with unbelievable care, they dig out<br>
a knot i swallowed, back on my tongue<br>
with a fresh fermented flavor, which,<br>
i&rsquo;m told, may affect the scent of my sweat.<br>
what does any of this have to do with<br>
the food that i eat, the materials<br>
of my home, the air of this dream?<br>
i don&rsquo;t know, the ending was unclear,<br>
i try to explain&mdash;to whom?&mdash;it depends<br>
on the translation&mdash;of who? the priest?&mdash;<br>
love is always failing and neverending.<br>
don&rsquo;t be afraid, it was great to see<br>
your smiling face, congratulations, can i<br>
hold you a little longer, some of me may stay<br>
hidden, nestled in the branches of a redwood,<br>
with its fine leaves and small cones,<br>
and call out each morning and afternoon<br>
as honestly as i possibly can.</p>
