  <h1>Third World</h1>
  
  <div class="post--content">
    <p>my body could have been much bigger or much smaller,<br>
but i am about the size of a string of a guitar,<br>
plucked or caught by your finger, or the space between:<br>
i try to settle in there.</p>
<p>i can remember sinking partially into a pillow<br>
and catching glimpses of another world, other voices,<br>
losing them on the sudden way up, and desiring.</p>
<p>unrelatedly, i dreamed that there was a third world,<br>
neither the dream i was in, nor the reality i came from,<br>
but a third one, i&rsquo;m tempted to say between, but all i know<br>
is that you had found a way there, and that from there<br>
you had found me, i knew because i sensed you trying to reach<br>
out to me despite your obvious absence.</p>
<p>and so i am getting less afraid of my death,<br>
but perhaps no less of yours or anything else.</p>
