  <h1>Contemplation week</h1>
  
  <div class="post--content">
    <h2 id="1">1.</h2>
<p>I wander like a hawk<br>
above the possibility of prey,<br>
I wander like the wind.</p>
<h2 id="2">2.</h2>
<p>Just like the land beneath these feet,<br>
these feet that walk over this land<br>
and the sensations of these feet walking over this land<br>
are not owned by me but by the timber company.<br>
Their signage is everywhere, and their machinery,<br>
and their creation and destruction,<br>
these traces of their true nature,<br>
which remains invisible.</p>
<p>To summarize: here on this forest road,<br>
betweeen thickets of trees, I am trespassing.<br>
The yellow and black striped warning tape was cut,<br>
it waves quietly in the wind.</p>
<h2 id="3">3.</h2>
<p>Other than humans, who have drawn up<br>
many nutrients from the soil, and proliferated,<br>
large animals are few and barely reveal themselves.<br>
One gallops by while my sight is closed<br>
and my attention is mostly in my limbs.<br>
Another takes off, or dives, in the cover of the brush,<br>
from one unknown realm to another,<br>
as I continue along the exposed trail.</p>
<h2 id="4">4.</h2>
<p>There are ways that the light falls in the thicket<br>
only.</p>
<h2 id="5">5.</h2>
<p>Falling asleep, I am haunted by the day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>A stone kneeling beside me in the garden<br>
flashes me a message as<br>
I kill the thistle and teasel,<br>
with whom I live and die.</p>
<p>I listen to the muffled memories<br>
of the ghost of the creek<br>
as I choke it with coarse debris.</p>
<p>Over and over I drive an axe into the bark<br>
of a fallen tree, to gain purchase and to peel,<br>
to discover the messages that were sent<br>
between the skin and the flesh.</p>
<h2 id="6">6.</h2>
<p>The meeting hall chants along;<br>
it has its own creaks to work out.<br>
The bamboo moves through its own<br>
subtle asanas, and keeps becoming.</p>
<h2 id="7">7.</h2>
<p>The world isn&rsquo;t flat, I heard it fold under a bird&rsquo;s wing.<br>
So that knowledge appeared in the pocket of an ear<br>
and then climbed into a poem.</p>
<h2 id="8">8.</h2>
<p>If you pass through the pines,<br>
and make a second effort,<br>
you&rsquo;ll find that the creek still lives.<br>
There is the sky, right on the earth,<br>
rippling as the birds ring<br>
and insects laugh and light dances.<br>
The light, and hence the dark, attends<br>
to everything, and I follow. When I depart,<br>
I am caught by the vines, who have missed me.</p>
