  <h1>Cactus Garden</h1>
  
  <div class="post--content">
    <p>I feel that something strange could happen here.<br>
I followed the signs to the cactus garden<br>
and sat cross-legged on a bench,<br>
my shoes and bags configured below.<br>
There is not too much light here, just small lamps<br>
placed at the base of the plants along the path.<br>
Every so often, someone new enters the garden.<br>
A male security guard. A female security guard.<br>
A girl, who is with her mother, notices a lizard<br>
on an abandoned cup near me, which I had not.<br>
They circle the garden, then the mother asks me to take<br>
their photo, gesturing repeatedly to raise the brightness<br>
of the image on her phone as she hands it to me.<br>
I try to frame them and the cacti appropriately.<br>
Thank you. The cacti move in the wind. The lizard becomes two.<br>
I’m waiting for something strange to happen<br>
and I’m breathing, trying to become a part of the interim.<br>
As I get up to leave, I turn and see the two guards,<br>
their uniformed intimacy, the orange of their cigarettes.</p>
