  <h1>Mercer Meadows</h1>
  
  <div class="post--content">
    <p>Hmm&hellip; where did you come from?<br>
You have no memories, no name, only artifacts<br>
in the corners of your eyes&mdash;saffron glow,<br>
ghost shadow&mdash;and many sounds&mdash;the cries of a tree<br>
calculating its fall, the pleas of exclosed deer,<br>
the sky filled with the dark of the moon and beats<br>
of an invisible helicopter&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t it seem a bit low?<br>
Who are you to say that that bird is not the god of weather?<br>
First hear and then enter its howl.<br>
How gentle, how wild.</p>
<p>Now, suddenly, you reach a small culdesac,<br>
which was not there before, and you pass a house abandoned<br>
and garnished with pink and yellow flowers, and you approach<br>
the shortened basketball hoop at the mouth of the street.<br>
This is not where you came from, this is your home.</p>
