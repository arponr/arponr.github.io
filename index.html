  <p><a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouA-U4x17KYHi">Hello, Arpon
    here</a>. I, like many Americans, am excellent at consuming: a
    mortifying proportion of my time is stolen by some people creating
    heartwrenchingly good television and music. But I want badly to
    understand and create things too. This website currently serves
    foremost as an impelling reminder of how little of that I've done
    so far. But hopefully interesting things will start turning up
    here somewhat regularly sometime soon.</p>

  <p>I'm most seriously pursuing <a href="/math">math</a> (primarily
    focused on homotopy theory for the time being), but in my free
    time I'm distracted by trying to write <a href="/art">music and
    words</a>, and of course by that oh so dangerous
    activity, <a href="/thoughts">thinking about things</a>.</p>

  <p>If you're trying to find me (and you're not evil), I'll be
    spending the 2015&ndash;16 academic year at Cambridge
    University. And you can reach me
    at <a href="mailto:arpon.raksit@gmail.com">arpon.raksit@gmail.com</a>.</p>
