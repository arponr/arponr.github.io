## Introduction

[Hello, Arpon here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouA-U4x17KY). I'm a graduate student in mathematics often distracted by stuff that's not mathematics.

Mathematically my thoughts are usually somewhere around homotopy theory. Some of those thoughts get written down and stored on my [math page](/math).

Things that have been distracting me recently include: [reading books](/reading), [creative writing](/writing), music, running, tennis, (web) design, and of course the eternal and fatal one: TV.

## Purpose

This site exists basically for me and my vanity. (In fact if you're neither of those then I'm surprised and maybe a little scared but ultimately proud that you're here.) It's constructive, though, as a place where I can experiment with design. The grandest utilitarian hope for the site is as a container in which I can put things I create. The hope being that the container-thing logic will reverse somehow, so that the container will facilitate organizationally and motivationally in actually creating the things, and thereby in my Sisyphean efforts at making progress in some of those interests/distractions listed above.

## Contact

Some more information is available in my [r&eacute;sum&eacute;](/files/resume.pdf). You can reach me at [arpon.raksit@gmail.com](arpon.raksit@gmail.com).
