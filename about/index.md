As far as I can tell, this site exists basically for me and my vanity (pictured above; if you're neither of those, then I'm surprised and maybe a little scared but ultimately proud that you're here). It is sometimes constructive, though, as a place where I can experiment with design. The grandest---and, as one will quickly deduce from a look around, most na√Øve---utilitarian hope for the site is as a container in which I can put things I create, the hope being that the container-thing logic will somehow reverse, the container facilitatating organizationally and motivationally in actually creating the things, and thereby in the sisyphean efforts at pursuing the interests listed above.
