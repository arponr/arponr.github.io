I'm Arpon Raksit, an undergraduate at Harvard. I'm trying (to try) my
best at understanding and producing interesting things. This site is
basically a place to record any minimal progress which may occur, in
the form of [posts][posts] and [notes][notes], which I guess right now
are just two words I chose to separate HTML things and PDF things, but
labelling them as HTML and PDF seems too weird to me.

At this brief moment I am most interested in: math, music, fiction,
and writing. I am also interested in (and at other moments I have been
and will be most interested in): computer science, design, tennis, and
running.
