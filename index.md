## Introduction

[Hello, Arpon here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouA-U4x17KY). I'm a graduate student in mathematics, but I'm often distracted by stuff that's not mathematics.

My [mathematical thoughts](/math) are usually somewhere around homotopy theory. My [academic webpage](/academic) contains some of my longer mathematical writing.

Things that have been distracting me recently include: [fiction](/reading), [creative writing](/writing), and music.
