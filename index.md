[Hello, Arpon here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouA-U4x17KY). Welcome to my webpage.

The mind is a messy thing; I try to use this space as a vessel for organizing, linearizing, designing, externalizing parts of mine.

* * *

As illustrated by the adjacent photo, I am often confused, amused, or both at once. Much of the time, this is because I am doing [mathematics](/math). Other times, it's because I'm wearing a large hat and incapable of posing for photographs.

In addition to math, I find sustenance in [fiction](/tag/reading), [creative writing](/tag/writing), music, tennis, running, connecting to other people, philosophizing about all of the above, and banter.
