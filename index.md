I am Arpon Raksit and trying (to try) my best to understand and create
interesting things. Welcome to the closet in which I stash any minimal
[progress][browse] which occurs towards these ends.

At this brief moment I am most interested in math, music, fiction, and
writing. I am also interested in---and at other moments I have been
or will be most interested in---computer science, design, tennis,
and running.

I don't actually interface with others in closets. But you can reach
me at [arpon.raksit@gmail.com][mail].
