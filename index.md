I'm Arpon Raksit, an undergraduate at Harvard. I'm mostly focused on
trying to understand (parts of) math. This site is basically a place
for me to [blog][blog] short snippets, and keep some longer expository
[writing][writing], on the subject.

I'm nearly always distracted by design, music, programming, running,
tennis, or tv. This place is also an outlet for these things---I might
occasionally post about them, and I'm constantly redesigning the site
for no reason.
