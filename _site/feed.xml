      <title>Metro North</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’re on the Metro North Railroad traveling from Grand Central Station to Stamford, CT, seated facing the rear of the train, neck twisted towards the window on your left. Slip in your earbuds and welcome the crooning of that Irish genius into your blood. Your eyes open and close as the old train wobbles leisurely out of the dim tunnel. Out in the city air the train accelerates and steadies. The darkness remains, though, the night creeping into day as summer tapers away. Two images alternatingly slide through the window: city streets run perpendicularly away from the tracks between slabs of apartment buildings embossed in the night. The streets are lined with lampposts and are bare but alive. Out of some unlit corners near the tracks pop bright red LED crosses and coffee cups and showtimes. And nailed high above everything is the moon, almost full, glowing softly behind invisibly thin clouds. The train accelerates again at the edge of the city, over the glossy black Hudson. That Irish voice soars higher and higher and upon its wings something familiar rises up inside you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is very beautiful, you think. You should write it all down, you think, for remembering, for discovering a literary heaviness in it all to ground and guide you. But you get lost in it instead. You forget everything the moment you see it. You feel lighter and lighter and you rise and rise into it, sprawl out on the moon and breathe it in before it’s all just emptiness and monsters again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heart Hotel</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Waft up into the atmosphere with all the other in-flight scents, for
some precisely prescribed but immaterial length of time, drifting and
swirling and who knows what goes on at those altitudes, till the
prescription runs out and you are sucked down into the world. Fall
through infinity—fractals of branching passages, vague semiotics,
and cordoned sinusoids—till infinity spits you out in front of
Arrivals. Watch sinister, swarthy creatures slouching by towards
Departures while you wait to diffuse into some vehicle which barely
stops and then flows, onward, submerged in a viscous
cavalcade. Surface and emerge, finally, at your destination. The night
is dark red and pulsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come inside, welcome. This hotel is nestled at the heart of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;floor-eleven&quot;&gt;Floor Eleven&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s October of 2004, and the hallway is lined with those lurid
lockers, the ones which send the average American hurtling back in
fits of nostalgia toward some teenage point in spacetime. Only this is
one of my not-even-teen years, and it’s right here and now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at me—no, not at me, at not-even-teen me—leaning like I must
have seen on tv against an orange locker adjacent to her orange
locker. I’m fidgeting, imperceptibly I hope, maybe even just
inwardly. A pen full of red ink comes out of my pocket and into my
hand and begins to fidget with me. What am I saying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“. . . .”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I capital-L Like, a.k.a. like-like, her. Who knows why. Are we even
friends? Seriously, what am I saying? That capital-L has planted
itself right inside me, its roots reach far deeper than my sorry logic
could ever dig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“. . . .”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My neck squirms, eyes wander, searching for some wit or charm or
something, but something else finds me: the pen explodes. The
idiomatic explosion is more metaphoric than literal though, the spray
of ink scrawny and pathetic, yet in perfectly catastrophic trajectory,
existing in all the wrong places and moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am too young for innuendo to apply. This is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear god, I am bleeding all over her and her baby-blue North Face
fleece. So many dreams shatter around me as my glossy oxygenated red
struggles to harmonize with her soft baby-blue, like some grotesque
hall of inconsistently colored mirrors. My neck snaps into place, eyes
freeze, and, as neck- and eye-mobility appear to be gradually
transferred over to her, she slowly lifts her heavy gaze from her
orange locker. The gaze, expressing and therefore evoking terror,
thuds down onto me. I need to react. I Like her so much I’m
bleeding. I need a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laugh. I double over, laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her terror metamorphoses in between eye-blinks: into anger, then
sadness, then disgust; all those feelings I decide between mirroring
eye-blinks I had always wanted from her. Yes, of course, I hate her
with all my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“. . . .”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does she say something? A ventricle is pounding at my ear, and I am
far too busy with my laughter. A bell interposes to notify us the day
is over, cackling along with me as my brand new nemesis storms off
into the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;me: hey s—-
s: hi what’s up?
me: not much, chilling
…
s: you want to see this video my dance team recorded?
me: yeak ok
s: [url]
…
me: i didn’t really like it
s: … are you serious
me: i guess i didn’t really get it
s: what
s: i’m dancing what’s there to get
me: sorry
s: why would you say that
me: sorry!
me: it’s not about you i guess i just don’t get dance
s: so still
s: why would you say you don’t like it
s: k—- said he liked it
s: why couldn’t you just
me: sorry&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</title>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;ideas&quot;&gt;Ideas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The wind-up bird
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Forgot to track this for the first ~200 pages&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;257, 278, 403&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The vacant house
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;43–44, 46, 172, 238, 261, 310, 368, 393, 409, 459, 528–533&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The flow, water, wells
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;51, 55, 58–59, 105, 125, 162, 175, 179, 213, 224–225, 265, 319, 359, 409, 449&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Light destructive / blinding
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;130, 158–159, 163, 165–167, 170, 208–209, 220, 222, 256, 258, 315–316&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the relationship between Kumiko and Creta Kano?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;didn’t track this for the first ~250 pages&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;298&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does Toru switching the phone between hands mean anything?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;didn’t track this for the first ~250 pages&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;281, 466, 536&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quotations&quot;&gt;Quotations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But after all, Mr. Okada, when one is speaking of the essence of things, it often happens that one can only speak in generalities. Concrete things certainly do command attention, but they are often little more than trivia. Side trips. The more one tries to see into the distance, the more generalized things become. (44)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The point is, not to resist the flow. You go up when you’re supposed to go up and down when you’re supposed to go down. When you’re supposed to go up, find the highest tower and climb to the top. When you’re supposed to go down, find the deepest well and go down to the bottom. When there’s no flow, stay still. If you resist the flow, everything dries up, the world is darkness. (51)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On days like this the clouds probably absorbed the sounds from the surface of the earth. And not just sounds. All kinds of things. Perceptions, for example. (58)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a narrow world, a world that was standing still. But the narrower it became, and the more it betook of stillness, the more this world that enveloped me seemed to overflow with things and people that could only be called strange. They had been there all the while, it seemed, waiting in the shadows for me to stop moving. And every time the wind-up bird came to my yard to wind its spring, the world descended more deeply into chaos. (125)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seemed to take a very long time for me to hit bottom. In reality, it could not have been more than a few seconds, but I do recall thinking about a great many things on my way down. I thought about my hometown, so far away. I thought about the girl I slept with just once before they shipped me out. I thought about my parents. I recall feeling grateful that I had a younger sister and not a brother: even if I was killed, they would still have her and not have to worry about her being taken by the army. I thought about rice cakes wrapped in oak leaves. Then I slammed into dry ground and lost consciousness for a moment. It felt as if all the air inside me had burst through the walls of my body. I thudded against the well bottom like a sandbag. (163)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had that tendency toward solitude common to only children. When trying to acomplish something serious, I liked to do it myself. Having to check things out with other people and get them understand seemed to me a great waste of time and energy when it was a lot easier to work alone in silence. (232)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if this’ll make any sense to you: When we got married, six years ago, the two of us were trying to make a brand-new world—like building a new house on an empty lot. We had this clear image of what we wanted. We didn’t need a fancy house or anything, just something to keep the weather out, as long as the two of us could be together. We didn’t need any extras. Things would just get in the way. It all seemed so simple to us. Have you ever had that feeling—that you’d like to go to a while different place and become a whole different self? (261)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t seem to realize that. You were made somewhere else. (261)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘You cand I joined our bodies together in my mind.’ When I heard myself actually speaking these words, I felt as if I had just hung a bold surrealistic painting on a white wall. And then, as if looking at the painting from a distance to make sure it was not hanging crooked, I said the words again: ‘You and I joined our bodies together in my mind.’ (308)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know if there is anything I can give you. It seems to me that I don’t have anything to give at this point in time. I am quite literally empty. I am just getting started, putting some contents into this empty container little by little. I can give you myself, Mr. Okada, if you say that is good enough for you. I believe we can help each other. (311)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s kind of like &lt;em&gt;The Magic Flute&lt;/em&gt;. You know: Mozart. Using a magic flute and magic bells, they have to save a princess who’s being held captive in a faraway castle. … In the opera, the prince and the birdcatcher are led to the castle by three children riding on a cloud. But what’s really happening is  a battle between the land of day and the land of night. The land of night is trying to recapture of princess from teh land of day. Midway through the opera, the heroes can’t tell any longer which side is right—who is being held captive and who is not. (406)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember when I kissed your mark that time? I’ve been thinking about that ever since I said goodbye to you last summer, thinking about it over and over, like a cat watching the rain fall, and wondering &lt;em&gt;what was that all about?&lt;/em&gt; (462)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Logic</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a dream I often have (I’ve had it about three times a week for
the last twenty years). There are two humans, one male and one female,
standing in a forest. I know that the forest is in upstate New York
(U.S.A.), though I can unfortunately be no more specific than that,
and really it’s not even clear to me how I know that the forest is
where I say it is. The man is leaning against one of the hundreds of
trees surrounding them; he is playing a worn acoustic guitar and is
singing. The woman is roughly two paces away, facing the man, and is
singing too. From the position and movement of the sun I’ve deduced
that it’s around 4:30pm and that the slight breeze is entering the
scene from the northeast. The humans play a single song: this is the
dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose this puts me in better position than the countless children
paralyzed by recurring nightmares, or the countless parents therefore
suffering from parades of sleepless nights. But, of course, such
comparisons are arbitrary and meaningless. There are millions and
millions of dimensions along which I might compare myself and little
nightmare-plagued Billy, and how could I ever decide on the relative
values of all of these dimensions? In one dimension I am listening to
quiet folk music in the midst of a forest while Billy escapes the
grasp of a vegetable-shaped monster. In another, Billy wakes up to a
mother’s soft lullaby while I drift from one inky nothingness into
another into another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two humans stand in the autumn of a New York forest. Radically old
wood towers around them; equally old wood lies hollowed, carved, and
stringed in the arms of one. The wood and the strings and the humans
vibrate. Listen: the vibrations are in New York and in your bedroom
and ripple out from your heart and for two moments you feel the beauty
of evolution, history, time, entropy, everything which created a
species that stands in melody and harmony among shimmering sunlight
and dancing leaves. And forget the two subsequent moments of cynicism,
for it is not actually True that the bacteria and the insects have as
much claim to the Earth as you. The Earth pulses with the beat of your
music. And forget the two subsubsequent moments during which you
realize that maybe the insects think they are making music too because
what is music and maybe we are just insects and…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not deduce yourself out of the Truth. Remember beauty and
vibrations and your heart. Remember.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finland</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I woke up in Finland today, in the grass. To be fair, I did yesterday too, and the day before that, and—well, I guess I don’t really know what I mean by ‘today’, though, or ‘yesterday’ or ‘the day before that’ or—what I mean is, for some time now I have been falling asleep and waking up in the grass in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to Finland in June on a sparse red-eye flight, JFK to HEL. Sitting in seat 21B between an empty 21A and 21C, I felt for the first time in roughly twenty years of somewhat frequent air travel the freedom to inhabit as much space as I wanted to, or rather, as god had always intended me to. And it is not lightly that I use the word ‘freedom’ here. In that great expanse I recognized something truly liberating: that the sensory irritants accompanying my conception of (economy/coach/third-class) air travel—the drone and odor saturating the cabin air; the pilot’s meaningless announcements and the fasten-seatbelt-sign’s unheeded dinging; the clanging of carts packed with stimulants and depressants up and down the narrow aisles—these ‘irritants’ are not actually irritating at all in and of themselves. While stepping onto an airliner does indeed stir an acrid bile within me, these inanimate and invisible environs are not its source. Their inanimacy and invisibility simply make them socially acceptable targets, convenient receptacles in which I, the civilized citizen, have been trained to spew my bile, in communal unison with my fellow citizens. No, the actual source is precisely these fellow citizens, the restless shifting and insistent wheezing and unabating, unadulterated existence of &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; just millimeters in every direction of my constricted body. It is human density that lends unbearableness to the drone and odor, the dinging and clanging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on this sparse red-eye, I—neighborless, uncompressed, liberated—fell gently asleep to the cabin’s reassuring whir and the pilot’s gibberish lullaby, the silent miming of the flight attendant tilting and blurring as I retreated beneath warm darkness behind eyelids. And, uninteruppted by others’ bodily functions, I slept soundly. I awoke during the plane’s final descent, burnt sunrise behind eyelids dissolving into faint light and refocusing outside the oval window in the pale morning sky. Crawling over to 21A and pulling myself up ever so slightly, I let my head rest at the edge of the oval cut-out and fixed my gaze on the rising sun. I made no voluntary movements for the remaining fifteen or so minutes of the flight. Never before had I simply watched the sun rise. It rose so slowly and deliberately, so heavily. In those final minutes, I felt I understood a bit closer to my core the heaviness of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Helinski for a night. Hotel bar. Nonsensical conversation / markov chain. Or maybe we don’t say in HEL for a night. Go straight to Ivalo, spend one afternoon in society, picking up gear and stuff. Stop in cafe and that’s where markov guy shows up, just like real life starbucks guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The items I brought with me to Finland can be divided into two categories. The first consists of those items covering my body (allowing me to move discreetly through society, like one of its own):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a pair of pants, on the darker end of khaki;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a pair of boxers underneath;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a short-sleeved t-shirt, medium grey and undecorated;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a long-sleeved button-up shirt, made of faded blue flannel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a jacket, darker blue and sort of rugged—or maybe that’s just how it made me feel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a pair of sneakers, bright red;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a pair of socks underneath;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an old black backpack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second consists of those items contained in the aformentioned backpack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;my passport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a collection of short stories by Franz Kafka;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a black leather notebook;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a mechanical pencil, along with extra lead and an eraser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an iPod nano (you know, one of those old-fashioned gadgets which, believe it or not, just outputs music) and a pair of headphones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left behind anything that could tell me the time, planning to leave here at sunset, which should be sometime in August. Perhaps this informs my confusion about all those words and phrases containing the word ‘day’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t hungry when I woke up today. To be fair, I wasn’t yesterday either, or the day before that . . . and that same spiel about today and yesterday and time and the sun of the Finnish summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I just lay in the grass, letting myself wake up, one bone at a time. The grass here is lush, green, soft, warm, beautiful, and so on. It’s grass that you can lie in, where you can bathe in the tireless summer sun, float down into a dreamless sleep and drift somewhere, some place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some place empty, but not cold or dark for even here the sun has not set—does time even pass? You are fixed here, and unsure if that or anything else will ever change, so you wait, the sun overhead, and you wait, and finally the sun has poured into you all that it could and you wake up, in Finland, somewhere, slowly, one bone at a time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in those final minutes, which may very well have been hours, I felt the heavy sun of the Finnish summer sink into me, slowly and deliberately. I dissolve into faint light, one bone at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>But I&#39;m not through</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Late Sunday morning and I are peeking at each other, from behind 97%-drawn window blinds and from beneath a 98%-pulled-up comforter, respectively. It After we’re each satisfied that the other’s really here, I turn onto my back, uncover twelve percent more of myself to stare at the ceiling and take inventory of things, sketch a todo list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come up 100% empty. Like five minutes have passed and my sketch is just a blank off-white ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dream Dance Die</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The young man was at at a party in a ballroom. He might still be. He was in requisitely nice black pants and white shirt; a dark grey tie hung firmly around his neck and new black shoes kept him just off the floor. He put his black jacket over the back of his chair as he seated himself at table number fourteen, because he had been feeling warm and had begun to sweat. Table fourteen was circular, draped with white cloth, and arranged consummately with nine salads on white plates flanked by gorgeous silverware and crystal glasses, just like the other thirty tables on the deep red carpet lining the outer portion of the ballroom, the carpet and the tables all surrounding the dark, lacquered wood dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He speared a cherry tomato with a single tine of his fork. A kernel of uneasiness was suspended inside him, swelling and contracting rhythmically but separately from and much smaller than his heart. Of course these are not the words that came to him. He just felt uneasy and that maybe his head was throbbing the slightest bit and that things were tilted by like a sliverish fraction of a degree in some way. But in reality there was this pulsating kernel, whose swells were steadily growing and whose rhythm was steadily slowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The salads were eaten and the dinners served and also eaten, and white shirts and black pants and colored dresses flooded the dance floor as music began to play. The young man really liked to dance, too, if the music was right. But he thought he should stay seated tonight, out of respect for the whole throbbing and tilting business. The problem is the right music came on after a while, which problem was exacerbated by his friends knowing that the music was right and basically throwing him onto the dance floor. He wasn’t angry though, because he did really like to dance, and in about a second all he cared about was the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shuffled and snapped. He lunged forward and jerked back. His hips snapped back and forth. And halfway through the song, he spun. At about 120 degrees everything slowed down incredibly. The last 240 degrees felt like ten seconds, during which the and the room tilted more severely and the whites and blacks and colors blurred together like his eyes shifted just out of focus.

      <title>Structures on manifolds</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to learn some stable homotopy theory this summer, and am
starting out by reading about bordism. My first goal is to understand
Thom’s computation of the unoriented bordism ring, i.e., the
classification of unoriented compact smooth manifolds up to
bordism. I’ve been following a couple of sets of notes by &lt;a href=&quot;//www-math.mit.edu/~hrm/papers/cobordism.pdf&quot;&gt;Haynes
Miller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;//www.math.umass.edu/~weston/oldpapers/cobord.pdf&quot;&gt;Tom Weston&lt;/a&gt;. I’m hoping to keep my own
detailed notes along the way, which I’ll probably put up at the end of
the summer. But I’ll try to post about some of it here as I go, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is the result of me getting rather confused about the
various bordism problems about “strucured” manifolds, and is
essentially just an attempt to sort out how I should think about these
“structures”. The structure comes from the stable normal bundle, so we
begin there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{notation}
Let $TM$ denote the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold $M$.
\end{notation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{definition}{normal-bundle}
Let $i \c M \to N$ be an immersion of smooth manifolds. The &lt;em&gt;normal
bundle&lt;/em&gt; $\nu_i$ of $i$ (or of $M$ in $N$) is the vector bundle on $M$
defined by the short exact sequence $0 \to TM \to i^*TN \to \nu_i \to
0$.
\end{definition}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{proposition}{normal-composition}
Let $i \c L \to M$ and $j \c M \to N$ be immersions of smooth
manifolds. Let $k \ce j \circ i$. Then there is a short exact sequence
[
0 \to \nu_i \to \nu_k \to i^*\nu_j \to 0
]
of bundles on $L$.
\end{proposition}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{proof}
Since pullback of vector bundles is exact we have
[
i^&lt;em&gt;\nu_j \iso i^&lt;/em&gt;\l(\f{j^&lt;em&gt;TN}{TM}\r) \iso \f{k^&lt;/em&gt;TN}{i^&lt;em&gt;TM} \iso
\f{k^&lt;/em&gt;TN/TL}{i^*TM/TL} \iso \f{\nu_k}{\nu_i}.
]
\end{proof}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{definition}{stable-normal}
Let $M$ be a compact smooth manifold. Let $[\xi] \in [M, BO]$ be the
homotopy class classifying the tangent bundle $TM \to M$ (stably). The
&lt;em&gt;stable normal bundle&lt;/em&gt; $\nu_M$ of $M$ is defined as the inverse of
$[\xi]$ in the group $[M, BO] \iso \wt{KO}(M)$.
\end{definition}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{remark}{normal-classifies-stable}
Note if $i \c M \to \R^n$ is an immersion (which always exists!) then
by definition we have a short exact sequence
[
0 \to TM \to i^*T\R^n \to \nu_i \to 0.
]
Since $T\R^n$ is trivial it follows that $\nu_i$ is inverse to $TM$ in
$\wt{KO}(M)$. Thus the stable classifying map $M \to BO$ of $\nu_i$
determines the homotopy class of the stable normal bundle $\nu_M$
(hence the terminology). But note that, by definition, $\nu_M$ does
not depend on the choice of dimension $n$ and immersion $i$.
\end{remark}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{notation}
Suppose we have maps $a,b,c \c X \to Y$. We denote a homotopy $h \c X
\times I \to Y$ from $a$ to $b$ by by $h \c a \to b$. We denote the
composition of homotopies $h \c a \to b$ and $k \c b \to c$ by $k *
h$.
\end{notation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{definitions}{f-structure-prelim}
Let $f \c B \to BO$ be any map and $g \c M \to BO$ a map from a
compact smooth manifold $M$. An &lt;em&gt;$f$-structure&lt;/em&gt; on $g$ is an
equivalence class of homotopy lifts $(\bar g, h)$ of $g$, where&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a &lt;em&gt;homotopy lift&lt;/em&gt; of $g$ is a map $\bar g \c M \to B$ and a homotopy
$h \c f \circ \bar g \to g$;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;two pairs $(\bar g_1, h_1)$ and $(\bar g_2, h_2)$ are equivalent if
and only if there is a homotopy $\bar h \c \bar g_1 \to \bar g_2$
such that $h_2 * (f \circ \bar h) = h_1$.
\end{definitions}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{lemma}{f-structure-bijection}
Let $f \c B \to BO$ and $g \c M \to BO$ as in
\ref{f-structure-prelim}. Then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a homotopy $k \c g \to g’$ determines a bijection $\theta_k$
between the $f$-structures on $g$ and $g’$;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if $k’ \c g’ \to g’’$ is another homotopy, then the bijections
determined by $k$, $k’$, and $k’’ \ce k’ * k$ commute:
[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix {
  {f\text{-structures on }g} \ar@{&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;}[r]&lt;em&gt;{\theta_k}
  \ar@{&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;}[dr]&lt;/em&gt;{\theta_{k’’}} &amp;amp;
  {f\text{-structures on }g’} \ar@{&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;}[d]&lt;em&gt;{\theta&lt;/em&gt;{k’}} &lt;br /&gt;
  &amp;amp; {f\text{-structures on }g’’}.
}
\end{xy}
]
\end{lemma}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{proof}
It suffices to simply give any maps $\theta_k$ satisfying (ii), since
then bijectivity is immediate from taking inverse homotopies. Let $k
\c g \to g’$ be a homotopy. There is a map from homotopy lifts of $g$
to homotopy lifts of $g’$ via $(\bar g, h) \mapsto (\bar g, k *
h)$. This evidently respects the equivalence relation so this descends
to give the map $\theta_k$. Property (ii) then clearly holds.
\end{proof}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{definitions}{f-structure}
Let $f \c B \to BO$ be a map and $\xi \in [M, BO]$ a stable vector
bundle on a compact smooth manifold $M$. An &lt;em&gt;$f$-structure&lt;/em&gt; on $\xi$
is an equivalence class of pairs $(g,\sigma)$, where&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$g$ is a map $M \to BO$ classifying $\xi$, i.e. $[g] = \xi$, and
$\sigma$ is an $f$-structure on $g$;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;two pairs $(g,\sigma)$ and $(g’,\sigma’)$ are equivalent if and only
if there is a homotopy $k \c g \to g’$ such that $\sigma’ =
\theta_k(\sigma)$; here $\theta_k$ is as defined by
\ref{f-structure-bijection}, which also shows that this is in fact
an equivalence relation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;$f$-structure&lt;/em&gt; on $M$ is an $f$-structure on its stable normal
bundle $\nu_M$.
\end{definitions}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{remarks}{f-structure-reform}
Note, since the $\theta_k$ are bijections, \ref{f-structure} is
equivalent to saying that an $f$-structure on $\xi$ is an
$f$-structure on $g$ for any fixed $g \c M \to BO$ clasifying $\xi$.
In the case that $f$ is a fibration we may reformulate this
further. Fix a $g \c M \to BO$ classifying $\xi$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let $\sigma$ be an $f$-structure on $g$ determined by a homotopy lift
$(\bar g, h)$. The homotopy $h \c f \circ \bar g \to g$ can be lifted,
since $f$ is a fibration, to a homotopy $\bar h \c \bar g \to \bar g’$
so that we have equality $f \circ \bar g’ = g$ on the nose. By
\ref{f-structure-prelim}, $\bar h$ gives an equivalence between the
homotopy lifts $(\bar g, h)$ and $(\bar g’, \id_g)$, where $\id_g$ is
the constant homotopy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So any $f$-structure $\sigma$ has a representative $(\bar g, h)$
where $h = \id_g$. Observe that two lifts $(\bar g_1, \id_g)$ and
$(\bar g_2, \id_g)$ are equivalent if and only if there is a homotopy
$\bar h \c \bar g_1 \to \bar g_2$ such that $f \circ \bar h =
\id_g$, which precisely says that $\bar h$ is a &lt;em&gt;fibrewise
homotopy&lt;/em&gt;. So finally, we may say (when $f$ is a fibration) that an
$f$-structure on $\xi$ is a fibrewise homotopy class of
lifts $\bar g$ in the diagram
\begin{equation}{f-structure-lift}
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix {
  &amp;amp; B \ar[d]_{f} &lt;br /&gt;
  M \ar@{–&amp;gt;}[ur]^{\bar g} \ar[r]^g &amp;amp; BO;
}
\end{xy}
\end{equation}
remember that here $g$ is any fixed map $M \to BO$ classifying $\xi$,
and these lifts are on the nose, not up to homotopy.
\end{remarks}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{examples}{f-examples}
Why should we care about fibrations $B \to BO$? Well, maybe the
primary class of examples will answer that. Whenever we have a
morphism of topological groups $\phi \c G \to O$ we get a fibration $f
\ce B\phi \c BG \to BO$. In particular if we have a sequence of
morphisms
[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix {
  G(0) \ar[r] \ar[d] &amp;amp; G(1) \ar[r] \ar[d] &amp;amp; G(2) \ar[r] \ar[d] &amp;amp;
  \cdots \ar[d] &lt;br /&gt;
  O(0) \ar[r] &amp;amp; O(1) \ar[r] &amp;amp; O(2) \ar[r] &amp;amp; \cdots
}
\end{xy}
]
we get a morphism $\colim_n G(n) \ec G \to O \ce \colim_n O(n)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’ consider \ref{f-structure} in the situation of a map $f \c
BG \to BO$. What is a homotopy lift $(\bar g, h)$ of a map $g \c M \to
BO$? Well $\bar g \c M \to BG$ classifies a principal $G$-bundle, and
the homotopy $h \c f \circ \bar g \to g$ specifies a reduction to $G$
of the structure group of the stable bundle $\xi$ classified by
$g$. And two homotopy lifts are equivalent when they induce isomorphic
reductions to $G$. Thus, for this class of examples, an $f$-structure
on a stable bundle $\xi$ is precisely an isomorphism class of
reductions of $\xi$ to a $G$-bundle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in this situation we will abusively refer to $f$-structures (on
bundles and manifolds) as &lt;em&gt;$G$-structures&lt;/em&gt;. Here are some important
subexamples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The most basic case comes from the identity $\id \c O \to O$,
inducing $f = \id \c BO \to BO$. It is immediate from the
reformulated definition of $f$-structures in
\ref{f-structure-reform} that very vector bundle on a compact
smooth manifold, and hence every compact smooth manifold, has a
unique $O$-structure. (And of course you’d expect there to be a
unique reduction of structure group from $O$ to $O$.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slightly less trivially we have the inclusion $SO \to O$ coming
from the inclusions $SO(n) \to O(n)$. This induces the two-to-one
cover $BSO \to BO$ arising from a choice of orientation. Indeed an
$SO$-structure on a manifold is precisely an orientation. Given the
discussion above, this should be believable, since giving an
orientation on a $k$-dimensional is equivalent to giving a
reduction of structure group to $SO(k)$. But we’re working stably
so there are some more details to this. We’ll work through these
details below since for me this example provides the most
intuition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The inclusions $U(n) \to O(2n)$ give a morphism $U \to O$ and hence
a fibration $BU \to BO$. A $U$-structure on a manifold is called an
&lt;em&gt;almost-complex structure&lt;/em&gt;. This gives rise to the setting of
complex bordism, which is supposed to be extremely important;
hopefully I will be posting about that later on this summer.
\end{examples}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the remainder let $M$ denote a compact smooth manifold and $f \c
BSO \to BO$ the map discussed in \ref{f-examples}. We’ll finish the
post by proving that $SO$-structures and orientations on $M$ are the
same thing, as promised above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{lemma}{normal-orient}
Let $i \c M \to \R^n$ be an immersion. Then giving an orientation on
$M$ is equivalent to giving an orientation on the normal bundle
$\nu_i$.
\end{lemma}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{proof}
By \ref{normal-bundle} of $\nu_i$ we have an exact sequence $0 \to TM
\to i^*T\R^n \to \nu_i \to 0$. There is a canonical trivialisation and
orientation of $T\R^n$, so orienting $\nu_i$ is equivalent to
orienting $TM$. But it is well known that giving an orientation on $M$
is equivalent to giving an orientation on $TM$, so then we’re done.
\end{proof}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{proposition}{SO-orientation}
Giving an $SO$-structure on $M$ is equivalent to giving an orientation
on $M$.
\end{proposition}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{proof}
Fix an immersion $i \c M \to \R^n$. Let $p \ce \dim(\nu_i)$ Let $g_0
\c M \to BO(p)$ be a map classifying $\nu_i$ and let $g$ be the
composition $M \to BO(p) \to BO$. Recall from
\ref{normal-classifies-stable} that $[g] = \nu_M$, and hence by
\ref{f-structure-reform} that giving an $SO$-structure on $M$ is
equivalent to giving an $SO$-structure on $g$. Combining this with
\ref{normal-orient}, we just left to show that giving an
$SO$-structure on $g$ is equivalent to giving an orientation on
$\nu_i$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;($\Rightarrow$) Suppose we have an $SO$-structure $\sigma$ on $g$,
represented by a homotopy lift $(\bar g, h)$. Since $M$ is compact,
and hence $M \times I$ is compact too, there must be some finite $q
\in \N$ such that the map $\bar g \c M \to BSO$ factors through
$BSO(q)$ and the homotopy $h \c f \circ \bar g \to g$ factors through
$BO(q)$. In particular we have that the factoring $g \c M \to BO(q)$
classifies the vector bundle $\nu_i \oplus \uR^{q-p}$, where $\uR$
denotes the one-dimensional trivial bundle. Now the map $M \to BSO(q)$
classifies an oriented vector bundle $\mu$ and the homotopy $h$ gives
an isomorphism of unoriented vector bundles $\mu \iso \nu_i \oplus
\uR^{q-p}$. With this isomorphism, the orientation on $\mu$ determines
an orientation on $\nu_i \oplus \uR^{q-p}$, and since $\uR^{q-p}$ is
canonically oriented this specifies an orientation on $\nu_i$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to check this does not depend on the representative $(\bar g,
h)$. Note that taking $q$ larger in the previous paragraph does not
affect the resulting orientation on $\nu_i$ since the map $BSO(q) \to
BSO(q+1)$ by definition classifies $\xi \mapsto \xi \oplus \uR$ with
$\uR$ given its canonical orientation. Thus, given another
representing pair $(\bar g’, h’)$ of $\sigma$ we may also assume $\bar
g’$ factors through $BSO(q)$ and $h$ factors through $BO(q)$. Since
$(\bar g, h)$ and $(\bar g’, h’)$ are equivalent homotopy lifts we by
definition have a homotopy $\bar h \c \bar g \to \bar g’$ such that
$h’ * (f \circ \bar h) = h$. I.e., if $\bar g’ \c M \to BSO(q)$
classifies the oriented bundle $\mu’$, then we have specified an
isomorphism $\mu \iso \mu’$ of oriented vector bundles which commutes
with the (unoriented) isomorphisms $\mu \iso \nu_i \oplus \uR^{q-p}$
and $\mu’ \iso \nu_i \oplus \uR^{q-p}$. It follows that the induced
orientations on $\nu_i$ will agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;($\Leftarrow$) Suppose we have an orientation on $\nu_i$. This is
equivalent to specifying a reduction of structure group of $\nu_i$ to
$SO(p)$, that is, an oriented $p$-dimensional vector bundle $\mu$ and
an isomorphism of unoriented bundles $\alpha \c \mu \iso \nu_i$. Of
course this is equivalent to a map $\bar g_0 \c M \to BSO(p)$ and a
homotopy $h_0 \c f \circ \bar g_0 \to g_0$. By composing with the maps
$BSO(p) \to BSO$ and $BO(p) \to BO$ we get a homotopy lift $(\bar g,
h)$ of $g$ defining an $SO$-structure on $g$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to check this does not depend on the choice of $\mu$ and
$\alpha$. Clearly another oriented bundle $\mu’$ and isomorphism
$\alpha’ \c \mu’ \iso \nu_i$ induces the same orientation on $\nu_i$
if and only if there is an isomorphism $\beta \c \mu \iso \mu’$ of
oriented bundles such that $\alpha’ \circ \beta = \alpha$. If $\mu’$
and $\alpha’$ correspond to a map $\bar g_0’ \c M \to BSO(p)$ and
homotopy $h_0’ \c f \circ \bar g_0’ \to g_0$ this is equivalent to
asking for a homotopy $\bar h \c \bar g_0 \to \bar g_0’$ such that
$h_0’ * (f \circ \bar h) = h_0$. Again composing with $BSO(p) \to BSO$
and $BO(p) \to BO$, this precisely determines an equivalence of the
homotopy lifts $(\bar g, h)$ and $(\bar g’, h’)$. Hence the resulting
$SO$-structure is well-defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two constructions are evidently mutually inverse, so we win.
\end{proof}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{remark}
Hopefully the argument in \ref{SO-orientation} has made it more clear
why we always need to specify our homotopy $f \circ \bar g \to g$, and
why the notion of equivalence of homotopy lifts is as it is in
\ref{f-structure-prelim}. In particular, observe that the commuting
condition on homotopies in the equivalence of homotopy lifts is
absolutely key. For example, suppose $\eta$ is an orientable bundle
and $\xi \iso \eta$ an isomorphism of unoriented bundles. The two
orientations on $\eta$ might in fact give isomorphic oriented bundles,
but tautologically won’t induce the same orientation on $\xi$ via the
isomorphism $\xi \iso \eta$. In this case the necessary commuting
condition isn’t satisfied. (Note, the two orientations on any
orientable bundle are always &lt;em&gt;stably&lt;/em&gt; isomorphic, since multiplication
by $-1$ on $\uR$ gives an orientation reversing isomorphism $\eta
\oplus \uR \iso \eta \oplus \uR$.)
\end{remark}&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bundles II: comparisons</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of the &lt;a href=&quot;/bundles-i-definitions&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, in which we
defined a sheaf-theoretic notion of &lt;em&gt;bundle&lt;/em&gt; over a
space, in analogy with the notion of fibre bundles. This time we
deal with a couple of comparison problems. Namely, we discuss:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;why our notion of bundle is in fact a strict generalisation of the
notion of fibre bundle;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the “change of fibre”, or “associated bundle”, construction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start by defining the categories which will feature in our
comparisons. We fix a space $X$ as we did last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{definitions}{fibre-bundle-cat}
Let $G$ be a topological group and $F$ a left
$G$-space. &lt;a href=&quot;/bundles-i-definitions/#bundles-structure-groups&quot;&gt;Recall&lt;/a&gt; that a $G$-bundle on $X$ with fibre
$F$ is a fibre bundle $\pi \c E \to X$ with fibre $F$ equipped with a
trivialisation ${(U_i,\kappa_i)}$ with transition maps in $G$. We
define a &lt;em&gt;morphism of $G$-bundles with fibre $F$&lt;/em&gt; to be a continous
map $\lambda \c E \to E’$ over $X$ and a common refinement ${V_j}$ of
${U_i}$ and ${U’&lt;em&gt;{i’}}$ satisfying the following condition. For
any $i,i’,j$ such that $V_j \subseteq U_i$ and $V_j \subseteq
U’&lt;/em&gt;{i’}$, the map
[
\begin{xy}
  \xymatrix{
    V_j \times F \ar[r]^{\kappa_i^{-1}} &amp;amp;
    \pi^{-1}(V_j) \ar[r]^{\lambda} &amp;amp;
    \pi’^{-1}(V_j) \ar[r]^{\kappa’_{i’}} &amp;amp;
    V_j \times F
  }
\end{xy}
]
is an automorphism of the form $(v,f) \mapsto (v, g(v)f)$, where $g$
is a map $V_j \to G$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This defines the &lt;em&gt;category $\Bun_G(X;F)$ of $G$-bundles on
$X$ with fibre $F$&lt;/em&gt;.
\end{definitions}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{definitions}{bundle-sheaf-cat}
Let $\G$ be a sheaf of groups on $X$ and $\F$ a left
$\G$-sheaf. &lt;a href=&quot;/bundles-i-definitions/#bundle-sheaf&quot;&gt;Recall&lt;/a&gt; that a $\G$-bundle on $X$ with
fibre $\F$ is a bundle $\E$ on $X$ with fibre $\F$ equipped with a
trivialisation ${(U_i,\kappa_i)}$ with transition morphisms in
$\G$. We define a &lt;em&gt;morphism of $\G$-bundles with fibre $\F$&lt;/em&gt; to be a
morphism $\lambda \c \E \to \E’$ of sheaves on $X$ and a common
refinement ${V_j}$ of ${U_i}$ and ${U’&lt;em&gt;{i’}}$ satisfying the
following condition. For any $i,i’,j$ such that $V_j \subseteq U_i$
and $V_j \subseteq U’&lt;/em&gt;{i’}$, the map
[
\begin{xy}
  \xymatrix{
    \F|&lt;em&gt;{V_j} \ar[r]^{\kappa_i^{-1}} &amp;amp;
    \E|&lt;/em&gt;{V_j} \ar[r]^{\lambda} &amp;amp;
    \E’|&lt;em&gt;{V_j} \ar[r]^{\kappa’&lt;/em&gt;{i’}} &amp;amp;
    \F|_{V_j}
  }
\end{xy}
]
is an automorphism given by the action of an element of $\G(V_j)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This defines the &lt;em&gt;category $\Bun_\G(X;\F)$ of $\G$-bundles on
$X$ with fibre $\F$&lt;/em&gt;.
\end{definitions}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{remark}
Note that all morphisms of $G$-bundles with fibre $F$ and morphisms of
$\G$-bundles with fibre $\F$ are isomorphisms (i.e. $\Bun_G(X;F)$ and
$\Bun_\G(X;\F)$ are groupoids). These are the notions of isomorphism
we will use for these objects.
\end{remark}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{remark}
It follows from a &lt;a href=&quot;/bundles-i-definitions/#auto-left&quot;&gt;lemma&lt;/a&gt; from last time that if $\lambda \c
\E \to \E’$ is a morphism of sheaves on $X$ with $\E,\E’$ both
principal $\G$-bundles (i.e. $\G$-torsors) then $\lambda$ is a morphism
in $\Bun_\G(X;\G)$ if and only if $\lambda$ is a morphism of right
$\G$-sheaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After proving a similar (also easy) lemma for principal $G$-bundles,
we can also see that a continuous map $\lambda \c E \to E’$ over $X$
between principal $G$-bundles $E \to X$ and $E’ \to X$ is a morphism
in $\Bun_G(X;G)$ if and only if it is $G$-equivariant.
\end{remark}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now show that the topological $\Bun_G(X;F)$ is really a special
case of the sheaf-theoretic $\Bun_\G(X;\F)$. &lt;a href=&quot;/bundles-i-definitions/#map-sheaf&quot;&gt;Recall&lt;/a&gt; that
to a space $Y$ we may associate the sheaf $\u{Y}$ on $X$ of continuous
maps to $Y$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{proposition}
Let $G$ be a topological group and $F$ a left $G$-space. Taking
sheaves of sections defines an equivalence of categories
[
\Bun_G(X;F) \iso \Bun_{\u{G}}(X;\u{F}).
]
\end{proposition}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{proof}
Before beginning observe that the action of $G$ on $F$ certainly
defines an action of $\u{G}$ on $\u{F}$, so the right-hand category is
indeed defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we first show that sheaves of sections in fact defines a functor
$\Bun_G(X;F) \to \Bun_{\u{G}}(X;\u{F})$. Let $\pi \c E \to X$ be a
$G$-bundle with fibre $F$ and trivialisation ${(U_i,\kappa_i)}$. Let
$\E$ denote the sheaf of sections of $\pi$. A section of $U \times F
\to U$ is simply a continuous map $U \to F$, so composition with the
homeomorphisms $\kappa_i \c \pi^{-1}(U_i) \to U_i \times F$ over $U_i$
determine isomorphisms $\u{\kappa}&lt;em&gt;i \c \E|&lt;/em&gt;{U_i} \to
\u{F}|&lt;em&gt;{U_i}$. Then the resulting transition morphism $\u{t}&lt;/em&gt;{ij} \ce
\u{\kappa}&lt;em&gt;i\u{\kappa}_j^{-1}$ is composition with the transition map
$\kappa_i\kappa_j^{-1}$, which is of the form
[
(U_i \cap U_j) \times F \to (U_i \cap U_j) \times F, \quad
(u,f) \mapsto (u, t&lt;/em&gt;{ij}(u)f)
]
for some map $t_{ij} \c U_i \cap U_j \to G$ since $\pi$ has structure
group $G$. Thus $\u{t}&lt;em&gt;{ij}$ is given by the action of $t&lt;/em&gt;{ij} \in
\u{G}(U_i \cap U_j)$. So indeed $\E$ equipped with the trivialisation
${(U_i, \u{\kappa}_i)}$ is a $\u{G}$-bundle with fibre $\u{F}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This defines the functor on objects. For morphisms, a map $\lambda \c
E \to E’$ over $X$ defines (again via composition) a morphism of
sheaves $\u{\lambda} \c \E \to \E’$. That the common refinement and
condition defining a morphism in $\Bun_G(X;F)$ imply the condition
defining a morphism in $\Bun_{\u{G}}(X;\u{F})$ is the same as the
argument above showing that $\E$ has structure group $\u{G}$ if $\pi$
has structure group $G$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now sketch why this actually gives an equivalence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Essential surjectivity: Suppose we have a $\u{G}$-bundle $\E$ with
fibre $\F$ and trivialisation ${(U_i, \kappa_i)}$ with transition
morphisms given by the action of $t_{ij} \in \u{G}(U_i \cap
U_j)$. We form a $G$-bundle $\pi \c E \to X$ with fibre $F$ by
gluing the trivial bundles $U_i \times F$ over each $U_i$ along the
transition maps $t_{ij}$. (This will be possible because they come
from transitions on $\E$ and hence satisfy the cocycle condition.)
It’s clear that the sheaf of sections of $\pi$ will be isomorphic to
$\E$.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Full-faithfulness: This follows from the fact that the morphisms in
$\Bun_G(X;F)$ are determined by the automorphisms of $V_j \times F$
which appear in \ref{fibre-bundle-cat}, and the morphisms in
$\Bun_{\u{G}}(X;\u{F})$ are determined by the automorphisms of
$\F|_{V_j}$ appearing in \ref{bundle-sheaf-cat}. Both automorphisms
determine and are determined by an element of $\u{G}(V_j)$, which
implies full-faithfulness.
\end{proof}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So any work we do in studying $\Bun_\G(X;\F)$ for general $\G,\F$ will
in particular give results for $\Bun_G(X;F)$ for general $G,F$ as
well. As a first example we discuss “change of fibre” for bundles,
which will allow us to relate bundles with arbitrary fibre to
principal bundles. This is also known as the “associated bundle”
construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{definition}
Let $\G$ be a sheaf of groups on $X$ and $\F$ a $\G$-sheaf. The action
of $\G$ on $\F$ is called &lt;em&gt;faithful&lt;/em&gt; if the induced morphism of
sheaves $\G \to \saut_X(\F)$ is injective.
\end{definition}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{proposition}
Let $\G$ be a sheaf of groups on $X$ and $\F,\F’$ be two left
$\G$-sheaves. If the action of $\G$ on $\F$ is faithful, then there is
a functor
[
\Theta_{\F,\F’} \c \Bun_\G(X;\F) \to \Bun_\G(X;\F’).
]
If the action of $\G$ on $\F’$ is also faithful then $\Theta_{\F,\F’}$
and $\Theta_{\F’,\F}$ are quasi-inverse equivalences.
\end{proposition}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{proof}
We first define $\Theta_{\F,\F’}$ on objects. Let $\E$ be a
$\G$-bundle on $X$ with fibre $\F$, equipped with trivialisation
${(U_i, \kappa_i)}$ and transition morphisms $\tau_{ij} \in \G(U_i
\cap U_j)$.
\end{proof}&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The insect and the M.D.</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s two o’clock in the suburban afternoon. A grey sky hangs low outside, whispering in the back of everyone’s mind re looming rainfall. Miscellaneous questions are caught in the whispers and whirl forward into consciousness, landing one after another in a paralyzing mess, like piles of crisp dead leaves you’ve tucked against the curb being scattered back over your lawn by gusts of wind. Are the cushions on the patio chairs out? Does the garden need to be humanly watered? Should that errand be run now or postponed until the rain has passed? The rain looms forever ahead in possibility and everything is grey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Do you want to go to Trader Joe’s?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Yeah sure.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world beneath the pregnant sky is hung together in a delicate mechanical balance, everything in rigid expectation of broken water. We glide through it towards Trader Joe’s, trying to perturb nothing. One instant of the drive stands out from the rest: an insect touches down on our windshield, an anxious rain-sensing wiper flinches, and the poor insect is jettisoned the same moment it lands. But the wiper, realizing its error, quickly restores the balance, and the rain cordially holds off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rain finally begins to fall on the return drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘What is this car doing?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the passenger seat, my eyes refocus and I see an old Mercedes sedan proceeding tortoise-like in front of us. The license plate has only five digits, prefixed by the letters ‘M.D.’ and hovering above the word ‘Physician’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I guess it’s a super old doctor.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Or his wife.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Hey the wife could be the doctor.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘That’s true. The hair is short though. Is it a man or a woman? I can’t tell. Can you see anything?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘No the rain’s in the way.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hollows in the shape of the genderless M.D.’s identity are slowly bored into our minds as we’re (barely) lead along this single-laned road. With each drawn out meter the rain thickens and the hollows deepen. Things, and time, begin to feel viscous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive’s penultimate turn grants us at last a road with a second lane, though only briefly, the two lanes merging just past the drive’s final stoplight. We slide over from behind the tortoise into the other lane, hoping to pass it and discern the M.D. while the lanes merge. But we lose ground during the maneuver. At the red light, our car is third in its lane and the tortoise second in its.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I think we still can pass, right?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘It all depends on the car in front of us now, and it doesn’t look too good from the gap between it and the first car.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her assessment turns out to be accurate. Beneath the green light, in a terrible display of patience, the car in front of us allows the M.D. to pull ahead of it. The distance between our questions and their answers increases measurably, palpably, hope-witheringly. I peer into the bottomless hollow and imagine a dry stone well. Is somebody down there? The darkness is impenetrable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We make our way through the hilly stretch between that final stoplight and the final turn. In every moment fresh grids of raindrops pack our windshield and are immediately jettisoned, between which we catch glimpses of the tortoise two cars away, still pulling us through mud. We roll down to a halt at the floor of the final valley. As we turn into our neighborhood, we watch the Mysterious Driver slip away into the grey, slow and steady amidst grids of rain, forever ahead in possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bundles I: definitions</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to sit down and understand how structure groups of fibre
bundles work. Principal bundles in particular seem like fairly
ubiquitous objects, and they’ll come up right away in the upcoming
posts about bordism. So I thought I’d work through the basics
carefully and write it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It struck me that much of the discussion can be translated immediately
to the more general setting of sheaves, so for fun that’s how I’ll
approach things. Of course I’ll point out throughout how the more
familiar setting of bundles fits into the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this first post is just to set things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We begin by defining the motivating players advertised in the title:
bundles and structure groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{notation}
Fix a topological space $X$ until further notice.
\end{notation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{definitions}{bundles-structure-groups}
Let $F$ be a space and $G$ a topological group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;fibre bundle&lt;/em&gt; over $X$ with &lt;em&gt;fibre&lt;/em&gt; $F$ is a map $\pi \c E \to X$
such that there is an open cover ${U_i}$ of $X$ and homeomorphisms
$\phi_i \c \pi^{-1}(U_i) \to U_i \times F$ over $X$ for each $i$. In
particular the fibre $\pi^{-1}(x)$ is homeomorphic to $F$ for every
$x \in X$.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Such data ${(U_i,\phi_i)}$ is called a &lt;em&gt;trivialisation&lt;/em&gt; of the
fibre bundle. The &lt;em&gt;transition maps&lt;/em&gt; associated to a trivialisation
are the maps
[
t_{ij} \c U_i \cap U_j \to \aut(F),
]
where $\aut(F)$ denotes the group of homeomorphisms of $F$ with
itself, such that the automorphism $\phi_i\phi_j^{-1}$ of $(U_i \cap
U_j) \times F$ is given by $(u,f) \mapsto (u, t_{ij}(u)(f))$.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A fibre bundle $\pi \c E \to X$ with &lt;em&gt;structure group $G$&lt;/em&gt;, or a
&lt;em&gt;$G$-bundle&lt;/em&gt;, is one where the fibre $F$ is equipped with a left
$G$-action and $\pi$ is equipped with a trivialisation for which the
transition maps $t_{ij}$ factor through the action $G \to \aut(F)$.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A $G$-bundle is &lt;em&gt;principal&lt;/em&gt; if $G$ acts simply transitively on the
fibre $F$, i.e., $F$ is homeomorphic as a left $G$-space to $G$
(which is a left $G$-space via left multiplication).
\end{definitions}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{remark}{principal-right-action}
Note that a &lt;em&gt;trivial&lt;/em&gt; principal $G$-bundle $X \times G$ has both a
left and a right $G$-action, via left and right multiplication on $G$.
Since these two actions commute and a principal $G$-bundle $\pi \c E
\to X$ locally looks like $U \times G$ as a left $G$-space, the right
actions on $U \times G$ will glue together to give a global right
$G$-action on $E$ which preserves fibres. I.e., any principal
$G$-bundle is a right $G$-space over $X$.
\end{remark}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the type of objects we should have in the back of our mind
throughout. We will generalise them using the language of sheaves,
with the following definitions as our basic tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{definitions}
Let $\G$ be a sheaf of groups on $X$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;$\G$-sheaf&lt;/em&gt; on $X$ is a sheaf of sets $\E$ on $X$ together with
a right action $\E \times \G \to \E$ of $\G$. A &lt;em&gt;morphism of
$\G$-sheaves&lt;/em&gt; $\E \to \E’$ on $X$ is a morphism of sheaves of sets
which commutes with the $\G$-actions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;$\G$-pseudotorsor&lt;/em&gt; is $\G$-sheaf $\E$ such that for all $U
\subseteq X$ open, either $\E(U)$ is empty or the action of $\G(U)$
on $\E(U)$ is simply transitive. A $\G$-pseudotorsor $\E$ is a
&lt;em&gt;$\G$-torsor&lt;/em&gt; if moreover $\E(U_i)$ is nonempty for all $i$ in some
open cover ${U_i}$ of $X$. A &lt;em&gt;morphism of $\G$-pseudotorsors or
$\G$-torsors&lt;/em&gt; is simply a morphism of the underlying $\G$-sheaves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a &lt;em&gt;trivial $\G$-torsor&lt;/em&gt; on $X$ given by $\G$ equipped with
the action given by right multiplication. A $\G$-sheaf $\E$ is
called &lt;em&gt;trivial&lt;/em&gt; if there is an isomorphism of $\G$-sheaves $\E \iso
\G$.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Note that if $\E$ is a $\G$-sheaf, then $\E|&lt;em&gt;U$ is a $\G|_U$-sheaf
on $U$ for any $U \subseteq X$. If $P$ is some property which can be
enjoyed by $\H$-sheaves on $Y$ for any sheaf of groups $\H$ on any
space $Y$—e.g. the properties of being a pseudotorsor, or torsor,
or trivial—then we say a $\G$-sheaf $\E$ on $X$ *locally has the
property* $P$ if the $\G|&lt;/em&gt;{U_i}$ sheaf $\E|_{U_i}$ has the property
$P$ for all $i$ in some open cover ${U_i}$ of $X$. The same goes
for morphisms of $\G$-sheaves.
\end{definitions}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{remark}
Note we should really have called these &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; $\G$-sheaves,
$\G$-pseudotorsors, and $\G$-torsors. Of course we can analogously
define &lt;em&gt;left&lt;/em&gt; $\G$-sheaves, $\G$-pseudotorsors, and $\G$-torsors. We
will need to distinguish between the two later on (as we needed to
distinguish between left and right $G$-spaces for bundles above), but
until then we agree to leave the modifier “right” implicit.
\end{remark}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{remarks}{torsor-equiv}
Observe that any morphism of $\G$-torsors is an isomorphism, since
clearly it must locally be an isomorphism. So suppose $\E$ is a
$\G$-pseudotorsor with a section $s \in \E(U)$ for some $U \subseteq
X$ open. Then there is a morphism of $\G|_U$-torsors $\G|_U \to \E|_U$
on $U$ given by
[
\G(V) \ni 1 \mapsto s|_V \in \E(V), \quad V \subseteq U\text{ open}.
]
As just observed this must an isomorphism. I.e., any global section
trivialises a pseudotorsor, and in particilar a pseudotorsor is a
torsor if and only if it is locally trivial. In fact, any $\G$-sheaf
is a $\G$-torsor if and only if it’s locally trivial. This is
immediate from the preceding discussion and the following lemma, that
being a pseudotorsor or torsor is a local condition.
\end{remarks}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{lemma}{torsor-local}
If a $\G$-sheaf $\E$ on $X$ is locally a $\G$-pseudotorsor
(resp. $\G$-torsor), then $\E$ is a $\G$-pseudotorsor
(resp. $\G$-torsor).
\end{lemma}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{proof}
It’s clear that the statement for $\G$-torsors follows immediately
from the statement for pseudotorsors, so we need only prove the
latter. Assume $\E|&lt;em&gt;{U_i}$ is a $\G|&lt;/em&gt;{U_i}$-pseudotorsor for all $i$
in an open cover ${U_i}$ of $X$. Let $V \subseteq X$ such that
$\E(V)$ is nonempty. Let $s, t \in \E(V)$. We need to show there is a
unique $g \in \G(V)$ such that $t = sg$. Write
[
V_i \ce V \cap U_i, \quad V_{ij} \ce V \cap U_i \cap U_j,
]
[
s_i \ce s|&lt;em&gt;{V_i}, \quad s&lt;/em&gt;{ij} \ce s|&lt;em&gt;{V&lt;/em&gt;{ij}}, \quad t_i \ce
t|&lt;em&gt;{V_i}, \quad t&lt;/em&gt;{ij} \ce t|&lt;em&gt;{V&lt;/em&gt;{ij}}
]
for all $i,j$ where these
intersections are nonempty. Since $\E|&lt;em&gt;{U_i}$ is a
$\G|&lt;/em&gt;{U_i}$-pseudotorsor, there is a unique $g_i \in \G(V_i)$ such
that $t_i = s_ig_i$; then
[
s_{ij}g_i|&lt;em&gt;{V&lt;/em&gt;{ij}} = t_{ij} = s_{ij}g_j|&lt;em&gt;{V&lt;/em&gt;{ij}},
]
so uniqueness also implies $g_i|&lt;em&gt;{V&lt;/em&gt;{ij}} = g_j|&lt;em&gt;{V&lt;/em&gt;{ij}}$. Since the
$V_i$ cover $V$, the $g_i$ glue to $g \in \G(V)$. The equation $t =
sg$ holds when restricted to each $V_i$ and thus must hold on $V$, and
the uniqueness of $g$ is immediate from the uniqueness of the $g_i$.
\end{proof}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s bring things back down to bundles for a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{definition}{map-sheaf}
To any space $Y$ we can associate a sheaf of sets $\u{Y}$ on $X$: the
&lt;em&gt;sheaf of continuous maps to $Y$&lt;/em&gt;, given by the assignment
[
U \mapsto \hom_\Top(U,Y), \quad U \subseteq X \text{ open}.
]
\end{definition}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{example}{bundle-example}
Let $G$ be a topological group. Then $\u{G}$ is in fact a sheaf of
groups. If $\pi \c E \to X$ is a right $G$-space over $X$ (a space
over $X$ with a right $G$-action preserving fibres) then the sheaf
$\E$ of continuous sections of $\pi$ is a $\u{G}$-sheaf in a canonical
manner. By \ref{principal-right-action}, any principal $G$-bundle
gives an example of such a $\pi \c E \to X$. In this case we will
moreover have that $\E$ is locally trivial, and hence a $\u{G}$-torsor
by \ref{torsor-equiv}.
\end{example}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We next generalise the main definitions we began with in
\ref{bundles-structure-groups}. I’m not sure if there’s standard
terminology for some of these things so I’m just sticking with the
terminology for fibre bundles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{definition}
If $\E$ is a sheaf of sets on $X$ then we have a &lt;em&gt;sheaf of
automorphisms&lt;/em&gt; $\saut_X(\E)$ on $X$ which to every open $U \subseteq
X$ assigns the set $\aut(\E|_U)$ of isomorphisms $\E|_U \to \E|_U$
of sheaves on $U$.
\end{definition}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{remark}
If $G$ is a topological group and $F$ a space then giving a $G$-action
on a space $F$ is equivalent to giving a continuous map $G \to
\aut(F)$. Observe similarly that if $\G$ is a sheaf of groups on
$X$ and $\F$ a sheaf of sets on $X$ then giving a left $\G$-action on
$\F$ is equivalent to giving a morphism of sheaves $\G \to
\saut_X(\E)$.
\end{remark}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{definition}{bundle-sheaf}
Let $\F$ be a sheaf of sets on $X$ and $\G$ a sheaf of groups on $X$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;bundle&lt;/em&gt; over $X$ with &lt;em&gt;fibre&lt;/em&gt; $\F$ is a sheaf of sets $\E$ on $X$
such that there is an open cover ${U_i}$ of $X$ and isomorphisms
$\phi_i \c \E|&lt;em&gt;{U_i} \to \F|&lt;/em&gt;{U_i}$ for each $i$.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Such data ${(U_i,\phi_i)}$ is called a &lt;em&gt;trivialisation&lt;/em&gt; of the
bundle. The &lt;em&gt;transition morpshisms&lt;/em&gt; associated to a trivialisation
are the automorphisms $t_{ij} \ce \phi_i\phi_j^{-1}$ of $\F|_{U_i
\cap U_j}$.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A bundle $\E$ on $X$ with &lt;em&gt;structure group $\G$&lt;/em&gt;, or a
&lt;em&gt;$\G$-bundle&lt;/em&gt;, is one where the fibre $\F$ is equipped with a left
$\G$-action and $\E$ is equipped with a trivialisation for which the
transition morphisms $t_{ij}$ lie in the image of $\G(U_i \cap U_j)
\to \saut_X(\F)(U_i \cap U_j)$.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A $\G$-bundle is &lt;em&gt;principal&lt;/em&gt; if $\F$ is isomorphic as a left
$\G$-sheaf to $\G$ (which is a left $\G$-sheaf via left
multiplication).
\end{definition}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact we could have left that last definition out, since according
to \ref{principal-equals-torsor} below, we have already defined it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{lemma}{auto-left}
Let $\G$ be a sheaf of groups on $X$. Any morphism of right
$\G$-sheaves $t \c \G \to \G$ is given by left multiplication by some
$g \in \G(X)$:
[
t_U \c\  \G(U) \ni h \mapsto g|_Uh \in \G(U), \quad U \subseteq X \text{
open}.
]
\end{lemma}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{proof}
Let $1_U \in \G(U)$ denote the unit for $U \subseteq X$ open. Let $g
\ce t_X(1_X) \in \G(X)$. Since $1_X|_U = 1_U$ and $t$ is a morphism of
right $\G$-sheaves we have for any $U \subseteq X$ open and $h \in
\G(U)$:
[
t_U(h) = t_U(1_U) \cdot h = t_X(1_X)|_U \cdot h = g|_Uh.
]
\end{proof}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{proposition}{principal-equals-torsor}
Let $\G$ be a sheaf of groups on $X$. A sheaf of sets $\E$ on $X$ is a
principal $\G$-bundle if and only if it is a right $\G$-torsor.
\end{proposition}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{proof}
($\Rightarrow$) Let $\E$ be a principal $\G$-bundle sheaf. So we have
an open cover ${U_i}$ of $X$ and isomorphisms $\E|&lt;em&gt;{U_i} \iso
\G|&lt;/em&gt;{U_i}$ such that the transition morphisms $t_{ij}$ are given by
left multiplication by some $g_{ij} \in \G(U_i \cap U_j)$. Since left
and right multiplication commute, the right actions of $\G|&lt;em&gt;{U_i}$ on
$\E|&lt;/em&gt;{U_i}$ via right-multiplication will glue together to give a
global right action of $\G$ on $\E$ (this is precisely analogous to
\ref{principal-right-action}). Thus $\E$ is a right $\G$-sheaf, and
since $\E$ is by construction locally trivial it must be a $\G$-torsor
by \ref{torsor-equiv}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $\E$ is a right $\G$-torsor. By
\ref{torsor-equiv} it is locally trivial: there is an open cover
${U_i}$ of $X$ and isomorphisms of right $\G$-sheaves $\E|&lt;em&gt;{U_i}
\iso \G|&lt;/em&gt;{U_i}$. So $\E$ is a bundle sheaf with fibre $\G$. Then that
$\E$ has structure group $\G$ is immediate from \ref{auto-left}.
\end{proof}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve said that we’ve &lt;em&gt;generalised&lt;/em&gt; the notion of fibre bundle
with this notion of bundles as sheaves. But we’ve been proceeding on
analogies alone. So though I’ve hinted at it in \ref{bundle-example},
I haven’t actually proved in what sense this is a generalisation. But
I’ll save that for the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Numbers at Google</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post about some numbers that I saw at work one day during my
internship at Google. I present them to you without further ado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21:&lt;/strong&gt; I got to run a job with 21 terabytes of input. &lt;em&gt;Tera&lt;/em&gt;. And
that’s compressed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10000000000:&lt;/strong&gt; 21 TB means I got to compute statistics on data
sets of size greater than 10 billion. &lt;em&gt;Billion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:&lt;/strong&gt; It took fewer than 3 hours to run that job. I love MapReduce
and resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23:&lt;/strong&gt; Later on, after realising I had made some stupid mistakes, I
needed to run that job again (and because it felt so damn cool the
first time, and I could, so why not). Anyway it turns out the data
was on some machines on the East Coast, and the job was running on
machines on the West Coast. That’s efficiency. Well so I (and, by
“I”, I mean someone else on my team who actually knew what he was
doing) managed to get the job running next door to the data. And for
ten minutes or so, that 21 TB was being sent to the job at more than
23 gigbatyes per second. &lt;em&gt;Giga&lt;/em&gt;. Holy bandwidth, batman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it turns out working at Google indeed has perks. Those numbers are
all due to some really smart people that work (or have worked)
here. That’s nice to think about. It’s even nicer to stop thinking
about that, look at those numbers, and just feel dope as hell, if
only for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps two moments, though. A new number arrived the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30:&lt;/strong&gt; After tweaking some things, the job ran in less than 30
minutes. That’s some astounding stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
