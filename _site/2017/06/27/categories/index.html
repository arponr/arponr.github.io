              <p>I learned today that there are two categories of people:<br />
those whose form depends on their company<br />
and those whose do not, who are the same, always.<br />
I am of the former category, like my mother,<br />
my sister of the latter, like my father.<br />
I am learning to respect the different people I have been<br />
and will be, and the peoples from whom I have been formed.<br />
<br />
I learned today that there are three categories of people:<br />
the nice ones, who follow, require direction, assist;<br />
the mean ones, who lead, who cut through others, edged;<br />
and the dreamers, who float outside the rest.<br />
Though I sometimes masquerade as one of the second category,<br />
I believe that I am, at heart, of the first,<br />
guided by my mother, who is of the third.<br />
I am struggling to achieve moral clarity or orientation,<br />
let alone movement. There is nothing and/or everything to follow.<br />
Edgeless, I bleed into the surroundings, ink in water.<br />
<br />
What is the role of the shapeshifting secretary,<br />
an inchoate chameleon? It is all that I can muster,<br />
that each of me be good to the company that created him.<br />
Yet there is so much else to be and do.</p>
