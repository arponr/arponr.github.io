          <p>I read Ben Lerner’s short novel <em>Leaving the Atocha Station</em><sup id="fnref:cite"><a href="#fn:cite" class="footnote">1</a></sup> while I was in southern Spain for a week (the story takes place mostly in Madrid, but briefly in Granada, and in fact I was on a bus to Granada while I read Adam Gordon (the main character) board a train to Granada!). I loved it. Here I discuss a few of my favorite ideas from the book.</p>

<h2 id="authenticity">Authenticity</h2>

<p>Adam Gordon’s driving problem in <em>Atocha</em> seems to be the problem of authenticity: the distance between his inner self and how he presents himself to, or how he is perceived by, the world, be it the art world and the readers of his poetry or the women he falls for. The conflict arises out of Adam’s central trait, his self-awareness. He’s constantly analyzing his possible actions and their possible effects, e.g. constructing his face and eyebrows to express impossibly precise attitudes, often in the realm of irony, thereby protecting himself from the vulnerability of authentically meaning what he says or does.</p>

<p>This distance is the key point: self-awareness is essentially a distance between your self and your self, and irony is essentially a distance between your self and your actions/words. An image from (and actually repeated a few times through) the text that communicates this well is that of imagining looking down at oneself as if one were a passenger on a plane. Adam includes this in one of his poems: “I imagined the passengers / Could see me, imagined I was / A passenger that could see me / Looking up…” [p. 40]. The image intimates perpetual removal from one’s immediate experience, always viewing one’s experience as if from a plane thousands of feet in the sky. The image is strengthened by the fact that Adam is super high when he first looks up at a plane and imagines this, a further distancing of himself from his immediate reality. This “seeing myself looking down at myself looking up” [p. 41] is expressed again later in the phrase “Por qué nací entre espejos” [p. 179], i.e. “Why was I born between mirrors” [p. 181], a quotation of Lorca.</p>

<p>Another interesting and sort of jarring example of this distance between self and self in the text is a sudden and brief switch between first to third person narration:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He, if I can put it that way, had felt this as a child when they sent him to camp … He became aware of a strange taste in his mouth; his saliva belonged to someone else; it made him sick to swallow. This he said to himself with authority, is a sign of schizophrenia; this is the beginning of the rapid fragmentation of your so-called personality; you will have to be hospitalized. He could feel the paper gown against his skin. …</p>

  <p>He would rush up the six flights of stairs, find the key, drop the bag, and throw himself on the bed. He would cover himself entirely with the blanket. He would take my siesta then. [p. 16–17]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This self-awareness is a kind of vanity, so what sends Adam spiraling into (even heavier) drug-use in the middle of the book is the realization that Isabel and Teresa see right through all his analysis and calculation, and moreover attach far less significance to him than he had assumed in his knotted, inbent selfishness.</p>

<h2 id="plurality">Plurality</h2>

<p>I think a key insight of <em>Atocha</em> is to connect the problem of authenticity and self-awareness to the notion of <em>plurality</em> of possibility, in everything, but in particular within language.</p>

<p>This idea first appears in the text in the context of translation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>something about home, but whether she meant a household or the literal structure, I couldn’t tell; I heard the names of streets and months; a list of things I thought were books or songs; hard times or hard weather, epoch, uncle, change, an analogy involving summer, something about buying and/or crashing a red car. I formed several possible stories out of her speech, formed them at once, so it was less like I failed to understand than that I understood in chords, understood in a plurality of worlds. Her uncle had died in a car crash a year ago today in a street in Salamanca; she had helped have he junky boyfriend hospitalizied over the summer and now he wouldn’t see her and had moved to Barcelona; her parents who lived in a small town were having their home foreclosed upon and she had been sorting through boxes of childhood toys; she had broken with a sibling over the war. This ability to dwell among possible referents, to let them interfere and separate like waves, to abandon the law of excluded middle while listening to Spanish—this was a breakthrough in my project, a change of phase. I kept quiet, modeling my face on the San Leocadio. [p. 14]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adam’s shoddy Spanish here at the outset of the novel exaggerates what happens even in expert translation: there is always a plurality of possible translations. I think the text also points to this happening not just in language-to-language translation, but in basically every part of the human experience: we are always perceiving some world of objects and events around us, and that perception and our interpretations of those perceptions are a kind of translation into our own language. And in that translation there is incredible room for plurality: objects can always be symbolic of other objects; this is referred to later as the “tragic interchangeability of nouns” [p. 145]. This plurality of interpretation is perhaps most acutely relevant to poetry—in fact Adam only seems to care about poetry in its ability to convey an</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>echo of poetic possibility. Insofar as I was interested in the arts, I was interested in the disconnect between my experience of actual artworks and the claims made on their behalf; the closest I’d come to having a profound experience of art was probably the experience of this distance, a profound experience of the absence of profundity. [p. 9]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a similar vein, he says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I told myself that no matter what I did, no matter what any poet did, the poems would constitute screens on which readers could project their own desperate belief in the possibility of poetic experience, whatever that might be, or afford them the opportunity to mourn its impossibility. [p. 38]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This kind of plurality appears probably on every page of this book. I’m exhausted just from flipping through and thinking of what examples to put here, so maybe I’ll just leave myself to flip back through my in-book notes (and you to read the book if you haven’t). One general example: the word “or” is used to great effect.</p>

<p>Anyway, this all has to do with the problem of authenticity. The impossibility of authenticity is in a way precisely the problem of translation. How can one be authentic when communication is such a lossy and fraught process? This link between authenticity and translation and plurality is particularly striking at what is Adam’s perhaps most (only?) honest moment in the novel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I said to her [Teresa] in English, “You are the most graceful and protean person I know. The way you handed me the coffee right when I awoke or the way just now you took the tequila from me or,” I pasued to think of an example not involving drinks, “the way you can move without apparent transition from your stylish apartment to a protest … But I’m worried you’re too cool for me, that you’ll realize I’m in fact a fraud. An inelegant fraud. I won’t be able to fool you and you’ll get bored” …</p>

  <p>“All you’re describing,” she said in Spanish, “is the personality of a translator. From apartment to protest, from English to Spanish.” If she had spoken in English, I would have found it a little grand. In Spanish I found it profound. I wondered if she’d weighed the sentence in both languages before selecting the one that would produce the desired effect. [pp. 141–142]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Teresa, “protean” and “translator”, is posed here as the antithesis of Adam, “inelegant fraud”. Adam views the impossibility of authenticity as the inescapability of fraudulence; his solution is to lean heavily into the fraudulence, the consuming self-awareness and vanity. Teresa rather <em>embraces</em> the impossibility of authenticity, i.e. embraces the plurality and elusiveness of identity, and “embrace[s] the tragic interchangeability of nouns” [p. 145]. That is, perhaps one must always view oneself as a translator, and in doing so give up on the impossible and quite possibly dangerous/useless notion of the authentic self (the authentic translation), “your own body ‘giving up / Its shape in a gesture that expresses that shape.’” [p. 146]<sup id="fnref:ashbery"><a href="#fn:ashbery" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>This is a reference to the following lines from John Ashbery’s poem “Self-Portrait In A Convex Mirror”:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Like a wave breaking on a rock, giving up<br />
Its shape in a gesture which expresses that shape.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Ashbery’s poetry is invoked multiple times in <em>Atocha</em> and there’s probably something interesting to say about that connection—in partcular, probably, with regards to the idea of a “convex mirror”—but as someone utterly oblivious about Ashbery and poetry in general, I don’t know really what that thing is.</p>

      <p>I <em>can</em> say however, that these same lines are also referred to by David Foster Wallace’s short story “Little Expressionless Animals”! Moreover, I think the lines are used there as well to suggest in some way the necessity of giving up one’s notion of self. In “Little Expressionless Animals”, the main character is unable to recognize others as truly distinct humans, with their own complete sets of thoughts and feelings not necessarily related to her own. In other words she can’t empathize, in particular with her mom and lover, and this inability to escape herself is responsible for a great deal of her confusion and pain.
