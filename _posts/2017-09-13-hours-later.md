It's years later now and still  
you appear in my dreams.  
<br>
Three nights ago to tell me sternly,  
in the shop you led me into  
with determination and fury,  
looking beautiful, who I am and  
always will be and never could be.  
<br>
And last night to say,  
"Do you need time before we hook up?"  
with desire and understanding in your eyes,  
as if I needed to move past something  
or somebody. A cathartic turn-on of a question,  
it ignites a quiet in me, "No. ... Tonight?"  
"Yes." Cut---so our parents take leave  
while you stay, get comfortable,  
and I was so happy that I woke up  
before much or anything else could happen,  
with a strange sensation of both  
regret and relief, having "left".  
<br>
It's hours later now and still  
you linger in my thoughts.  
Of the indelible past---  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the yearbook, your sweater,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my sweater, your sundress,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the texts and instant messages  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and facebook posts,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every meaningless thing  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you gave meaning  
---and of the impossible futures...
