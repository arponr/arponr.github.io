I learned today that there are two categories of people:  
those whose form depends on their company  
and those whose do not, who are the same, always.  
I am of the former category, like my mother,  
my sister of the latter, like my father.  
I am learning to respect the different people I have been  
and will be, and the peoples from whom I have been formed.  
<br>
I learned today that there are three categories of people:  
the nice ones, who follow, require direction, assist;  
the mean ones, who lead, who cut through others, edged;  
and the dreamers, who float outside the rest.  
Though I sometimes masquerade as one of the second category,  
I believe that I am, at heart, of the first,  
guided by my mother, who is of the third.  
I am struggling to achieve moral clarity or orientation,  
let alone movement. There is nothing and/or everything to follow.  
Edgeless, I bleed into the surroundings, ink in water.  
<br>
What is the role of the shapeshifting secretary,  
an inchoate chameleon? It is all that I can muster,  
that each of me be good to the company that created him.  
Yet there is so much else to be and do.
