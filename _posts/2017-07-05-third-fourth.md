Out on the porch / the pier  
the night is tinted indigo / violet  
and the moon is looking radiant.  
You can hear but not see  
the fireworks. Instead,  
with each explosion, the light  
of one or two or three fireflies  
among the trees / the reeds,  
like sparks freed from smoldering logs,  
or the glint of the flames in your lover's eyes,  
or in your heart, as you remember  
how you watched her watch fire.
