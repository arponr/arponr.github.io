i think therefore i am  
therefore i need therefore  
i want therefore i succumb  
therefore i bleed therefore  
i cup my hands in the river  
and i reflect.  
<br>
i am unrecognizable therefore  
i stumble therefore i forget,  
cannot remember how to remember,  
how to look in the eyes.  
<br>
i become aware of the slightest neuronal rustle,  
the slightest distance, the lightest shadows  
shifting and petals falling, the slowest beats,  
the lowest murmurs, the lowest culture  
and desire, the farces we enact,  
the greatest distances imaginable.  
<br>
therefore i must dig  
(there is gold beneath the earth),  
therefore i must love  
(there is gold within the heart).
