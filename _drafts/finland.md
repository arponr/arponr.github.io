desc: A short story about somewhere I haven't been (yet).

Today I woke up in Finland, somewhere, in the grass. To be fair, I did
yesterday too, and the day before that, and ... well, I guess I
don’t really know what I mean by 'today', though, or 'yesterday' or
'the day before that' or .... What I mean is, for some time now I
have been falling asleep and waking up in the grass, somewhere in
Finland.

I arrived to the country in June on a sparse red-eye flight, JFK to
HEL. Sitting in seat 21B between an empty 21A and 21C, I felt for the
first time in more than twenty years of quasifrequent air travel the
freedom to occupy as much space as I wanted to, or rather as god had
always intended me to. The word 'freedom' is not deployed lightly
here; the experience was truly a liberating one, for it revealed to me
the following. All of the sensory irritants that accompany my
conception of (economy/coach/third-class) air travel---the drone and
odor of the cabin, the pilot's meaningless announcements, the random
dinging of the fasten-seatbelt sign, the clanging of carts filled with
stimulants and depressants down the narrow aisles---these irritants
are not actually irritating at all in and of themselves. While there
is indeed an acrid bile stirred within me by the thought of an
airliner, these inanimate and invisible environs are not its
source. Their inanimacy and invisibility just make them easy and
socially acceptable targets upon which I, the civilized citizen, have
been trained to spew my bile. No, the source is nothing other than the
restless shifting and insistent whispering and unabating,
unadulterated existence of *people* just millimeters in every
direction of my heartrendingly compressed body.

So on this sparse red-eye, I---neighborless, uncompressed,
liberated---fell gently asleep to the cabin's reassuring whir and the
pilot's gibberish lullaby, the silent miming of the flight attendant
tilting and blurring as I retreated beneath warm darkness behind
eyelids. And, uninteruppted by others' bodily functions, I slept
soundly. I awoke during the plane's final descent, burnt sunrise
behind eyelids dissolving into faint light and refocusing outside the
oval window. Crawling over to 21A and pulling myself up ever so
slightly, I let my head rest at the edge of the oval cut-out and fixed
my gaze on the rising sun. I made no additional voluntary movements
for the remaining few minutes of the flight. It was the most
conscientously I've ever watched a sunrise, and I think I waited for
the right sunrise to do so. It rose so slowly and deliberately, so
heavily. In those final minutes, I felt I understood a bit closer to
my core the heaviness of the sun.

The items I brought with me to Finland can be divided into two
categories. The first consists of those items covering my body
(allowing me to move discreetly through society, like one of its own):

- a pair of pants, on the darker end of khaki;
- a pair of boxers underneath;
- a short-sleeved t-shirt, medium grey and undecorated;
- a long-sleeved button-up shirt, made of faded blue flannel;
- a jacket, darker blue and sort of rugged---or maybe that’s just how
  it made me feel;
- a pair of sneakers, bright red;
- a pair of socks underneath;
- an old black backpack.

The second consists of those items contained in the aformentioned
backpack:

- my passport
- a collection of short stories by Franz Kafka;
- a black leather notebook;
- a mechanical pencil, along with extra lead and an eraser.
- an iPod nano (you know, one of those old-fashioned gadgets which,
  believe it or not, just outputs music) and a pair of headphones.

I left behind anything that could tell me the time, planning to leave
here at sunset, which should be sometime in August. Perhaps this
informs my confusion about all those words containing the word 'day'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I wasn’t hungry when I woke up today. To be fair, I wasn’t yesterday
either, or the day before that . . . and that same spiel about today
and yesterday and time and the sun of the Finnish summer.

So I just lay in the grass, letting myself wake up, one bone at a
time. The grass here is lush, green, soft, warm, beautiful, and so
on. It’s grass that you can lie in, where you can bathe in the
tireless summer sun, float down into a dreamless sleep and drift
somewhere, some place.

*Some place empty, but not cold or dark for even here the sun has not
set---does time even pass? You are fixed here, and unsure if that or
anything else will ever change, so you wait, the sun overhead, and you
wait, and finally the sun has poured into you all that it could and
you wake up, in Finland, somewhere, slowly, one bone at a time.*

----------------------------------------------------------------------

And in those final minutes, which may very well have been hours, I
felt the heavy sun of the Finnish summer sink into me, slowly and
deliberately. I dissolve into faint light, one bone at a time.
