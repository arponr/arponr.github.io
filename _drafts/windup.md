## Quotations

- But after all, Mr. Okada, when one is speaking of the essence of things, it often happens that one can only speak in generalities. Concrete things certainly do command attention, but they are often little more than trivia. Side trips. The more one tries to see into the distance, the more generalized things become. (44)

- The point is, not to resist the flow. You go up when you're supposed to go up and down when you're supposed to go down. When you're supposed to go up, find the highest tower and climb to the top. When you're supposed to go down, find the deepest well and go down to the bottom. When there's no flow, stay still. If you resist the flow, everything dries up, the world is darkness. (51)

- On days like this the clouds probably absorbed the sounds from the surface of the earth. And not just sounds. All kinds of things. Perceptions, for example. (58)

- It was a narrow world, a world that was standing still. But the narrower it became, and the more it betook of stillness, the more this world that enveloped me seemed to overflow with things and people that could only be called strange. They had been there all the while, it seemed, waiting in the shadows for me to stop moving. And every time the wind-up bird came to my yard to wind its spring, the world descended more deeply into chaos. (125)

- It seemed to take a very long time for me to hit bottom. In reality, it could not have been more than a few seconds, but I do recall thinking about a great many things on my way down. I thought about my hometown, so far away. I thought about the girl I slept with just once before they shipped me out. I thought about my parents. I recall feeling grateful that I had a younger sister and not a brother: even if I was killed, they would still have her and not have to worry about her being taken by the army. I thought about rice cakes wrapped in oak leaves. Then I slammed into dry ground and lost consciousness for a moment. It felt as if all the air inside me had burst through the walls of my body. I thudded against the well bottom like a sandbag. (163)

- I had that tendency toward solitude common to only children. When trying to acomplish something serious, I liked to do it myself. Having to check things out with other people and get them understand seemed to me a great waste of time and energy when it was a lot easier to work alone in silence. (232)

- I wonder if this'll make any sense to you: When we got married, six years ago, the two of us were trying to make a brand-new world---like building a new house on an empty lot. We had this clear image of what we wanted. We didn't need a fancy house or anything, just something to keep the weather out, as long as the two of us could be together. We didn't need any extras. Things would just get in the way. It all seemed so simple to us. Have you ever had that feeling---that you'd like to go to a while different place and become a whole different self? (261)

- You don't seem to realize that. You were made somewhere else. (261)

- 'You cand I joined our bodies together in my mind.' When I heard myself actually speaking these words, I felt as if I had just hung a bold surrealistic painting on a white wall. And then, as if looking at the painting from a distance to make sure it was not hanging crooked, I said the words again: 'You and I joined our bodies together in my mind.' (308)

- I don't know if there is anything I can give you. It seems to me that I don't have anything to give at this point in time. I am quite literally empty. I am just getting started, putting some contents into this empty container little by little. I can give you myself, Mr. Okada, if you say that is good enough for you. I believe we can help each other. (311)

- It's kind of like *The Magic Flute*. You know: Mozart. Using a magic flute and magic bells, they have to save a princess who's being held captive in a faraway castle. ... In the opera, the prince and the birdcatcher are led to the castle by three children riding on a cloud. But what's really happening is  a battle between the land of day and the land of night. The land of night is trying to recapture of princess from teh land of day. Midway through the opera, the heroes can't tell any longer which side is right---who is being held captive and who is not. (406)

- Remember when I kissed your mark that time? I've been thinking about that ever since I said goodbye to you last summer, thinking about it over and over, like a cat watching the rain fall, and wondering *what was that all about?* (462)
