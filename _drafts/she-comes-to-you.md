## Namagiri Thayar

Suppose a being comes to you in a dream and says she is an avatar of God or the Universe or Plato or whatever. And, in the dream, it feels real and you believe her. And then she tells you the value of a zero of the Riemann zeta function with real part greater than $1/2$â€”just the value, without proof. But it feels real and you believe her. You wake up remembering the value, and in the first moments of wakefulness it still feels real in the way that dreams sometimes do. What do you do?

## The disjointed snake

- In class, matt katz and dillon together; jamie is a lesbian
- go upstairs and see chris chi playing the xx
- jamie's close by and says she's written down all the chords
- your eyes sort of zoom out / unfocus / abstract and see the shape of the chords
- then zoom back in and it's homological algebra, some exact sequences computing tor groups, she explains it to you 'cofibrant replacement'
- you look at her and kiss her (lean her back to the floor? we were sitting on the floor?) and immediately realize it's wrong so pull back up and see her expressionless face and say sorry
- this shifts to the feeling that jamie is pointing out some fundamental flaws about me... something about taking action / willpower?
- then i'm standing with one foot in a bathtub containing a water with segments of snake poking out, one segment has bit into my leg
- i still feel the fundamental flaw being pulled out of and washing over me, and i am aware that if i stand there and do nothing that i will die and that's what i feel like doing
- but something changes and i decide i need to overcome this and now jamie's gone and the snake becomes a more cohesive enemy somehow and i defeat it somehow and mince it up into like tuna salad looking stuff
- then i'm in a backyard yelling over to ma and baba that i saw all this on a tv show, it was a sinewy, crazy-haired black guy that did all this
- i wake up and the strongest sensation is that the homological algebra felt like it made sense. "Who are you?"

## The brain and heart

Suppose you fell in love last summer, had the kind of summer you'd assumed only occurred abstractly in stories and felt the kinds of feelings that you hadn't even believed in because you'd taught your brain to ignore your heart, the kind of summer and feelings you'd never even dreamed of---probably, you figure now, because it was your heartless brain doing the dreaming. Suppose, as a result of circumstances determined prior to your falling in love, that you moved far away in the autumn, and since you both knew from the start that you'd be moving far away in the autumn, you decided together---at the start, before the heart had staged its coup, so it was the brain that decided---that autumn's goodbye would have to be Goodbye, that it only made sense. And as a corollary you knew you couldn't say aloud that you loved her all the times last summer that you knew you loved her.

So suppose you cried and said Goodbye and cried and moved far away. But of course you're still in love, and now the heart's got you by the throat and won't move on no matter how loud the brain gasps, so it's simultaneously a holy, soul-sustaining succor and dark, chest-crushing burden that even now from far away you exchange messages with her all day, every day, that every night she wishes you a good night and fair dreams and a good morning from several timezones behind, and then sends you messages while you sleep, too, which you wake up to and read first thing in the morning, and which make you imagine being with her, watching her sleep at that very moment. But of course you still can't know how she sees you, how she reads you and how you should read her, because sometimes she feels close and sometimes she feels distant, and even when she feels close it may be not from love but from deep kindness and empathy and openness, all of which she has. And you're especially uncertain because you've, more than once, made her angry and sad, in ways that make you doubt whether she thinks you're a good person, or if she does whether she ought to.

Suppose it's winter and you are still actively in love with a faraway girl that you fell in love with in the summer, and that you've not told and you feel you cannot tell her you love her because you were supposed have said goodbye in the autumn, when one night she comes to you in a dream. It's in the home you grew up in, . It's dark except for some light spilling in from the hallway through the half-open door and some moonlight spilling in through the blinds. Her face is softly illuminated. Your arms disappear around her and hers around you. Your eyes lay in each others. It's like this forever. Time is lost in the black sky all around you, in the grey sand beneath you, in the formless wind in which you sway. And at the end of time she is kissing you. Gracelessly you lean over and kick closed the door, then lean back to her, into your home. You both descend onto the small bed, eyes gently shut and lips gently parted. And she is beside you and then you open your eyes briefly to see her, and so does she and she pulls away and her eyes shimmer and she says, 'I love you.' And with all your brain and all your heart you feel and you say 'I love you too.' And you close your eyes so it'll never change and you lean in again and then you wake up.
