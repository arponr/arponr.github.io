There is a dream I have had about three times per week for the past twenty years. In it, two humans, one female and one male, stand in a forest. I know that the forest is located in the United States of America, in fact in upstate New York, though I can unfortunately be no more specific than that, and really it is not even clear to me how I know that the forest is where I believe it is. The male is leaning against one of the hundreds of trees surrounding them; he is playing a worn acoustic guitar and is singing. The female is roughly two paces away, facing the male, and is singing too. From the position and movement of the sun I have deduced that it is around 4:30pm and that the slight breeze is entering the scene from the northeast. The humans play a single song; this is the dream.

I suppose this puts me in better position than the countless children paralyzed by recurring nightmares, or the countless parents therefore suffering from parades of sleepless nights. But, of course, such comparisons are arbitrary and meaningless. There are millions and millions of dimensions along which I might compare my and the little nightmare-plagued child's positions; how could I ever decide on all their relative values? In one dimension I am listening to quiet folk music in the midst of a forest while the child escapes the grasp of a vegetable-shaped monster. In another, the child wakes up to a mother's soft lullaby while I drift from one inky nothingness into another into another.

Two humans stand in the autumn of a New York forest. Radically old wood towers around them; equally old wood lies hollowed, carved, and stringed in the arms of one. The wood and the strings and the humans vibrate. Listen: the vibrations are in New York and in your bedroom and ripple out from your heart and for two moments you feel the beauty of evolution, history, time, entropy, everything which created a species that stands in melody and harmony among shimmering sunlight and dancing leaves. And forget the two subsequent moments of cynicism, for it is not actually True that the bacteria and the insects have as much claim to the Earth as you. The Earth pulses with the rhythym of your music. And forget the two subsubsequent moments during which you realize that maybe the insects think they are making music too because what is music? and are we not just insects? and...

Do not deduce yourself out of the Truth. Remember beauty and vibrations and your heart. Remember.
